(more precisely, a bubble can be defined as a disequilibrium event involving a steep increase in price that persists for a significant time, cannot be explained by fundamentals, and, after peaking, quickly gives way to a steep decrease in price.) we experienced what is widely believed (and what i believe) to be a bubble in housing prices between 1996 and may 2006, when average housing prices plateaued and immediately began to decline. between 2002 and may 2006 the median price of a house rose by almost 50 percent. between then and 2010 it fell by a third, and it has since risen slightly. one can imagine factors that would explain a steep rise and later a steep fall in the price of housing. they might include a sharp increase in incomes or wealth, or in population, or big changes in construction costs, zoning and building codes, commuting costs, family size, and so on, but such changes cannot account for the pattern of housing prices. what seems to have happened was that the prosperity of the second half of the 1990s increased the demand for and he",

(long-term interest rates are also affected, and in the same direction.) politicians like the money supply to increase before elections, because a reduction in interest rates stimulates economic activity; consumers borrow more to consume, and businesses borrow more to invest in production. in principle, consumers and businesses should anticipate inflation (if the money supply is increasing faster than the output of goods and services), resulting in higher long-term interest rates and various distortions in economic activity, and take preventive measures that will reduce the stimulative effect of the central\u2019s bank low-interest-rate policy. but we know from the reaction of consumers and producers to the very low interest rates of the early 2000s that the effect of very low rates on consumption and production are not fully and immediately offset by anticipation of future consequences. thus if a nation\u2019s central bank is controlled by politicians, it can be expected to reduce short-term interest rates at particular phases in the electoral cycle, and this tendency, because unrelated to any economic reasons for low interest rates, can be expected to have an inflationary effect. moreover, inflation can easily get out of hand. when inflation is anticipated, the amount of money in circulation increases; people hold smaller cash balances because inflation erodes the value of cash. the more rapidly money circulates, the higher the ratio of money to output and therefore the higher the rate of inflation.

(the best may be the tax on \u201ccadillac\u201d health-insurance plans, which i discuss at the end of this comment.) for example, the requirement that all chains with more than 20 stores must publish calorie information on menus and signs may contribute to reducing obesity, though the effect will be modest. but a typical measure included",

(if they would grow by 13 percent without any governmental effort, then the president\u2019s 100 percent program, if it succeeded, would actually have increased exports by only 83 percent\u2014though of course the government would take credit for all 100 percent!) how his program could accomplish this is incomprehensible to me. the increase in loan guaranties by the export-import bank would reduce exporters\u2019 interest costs by reducing their risk of losing money by extending credit to a foreign purchaser, but that would be a minor boon to exporters. likewise, anti-dumping enforcement and other efforts to prevent \u201cunfair\u201d pricing by foreign companies importing to the united states are likely simply to provoke retaliation--limiting our exports\u2014as happened in our recent tiff with china over imports of",

(if it were, there would be no urgency about taking measures to slow it, for normal technological progress will eventually solve the problem at low cost.) the particular danger which concerns me, and which i emphasized in my book catastrophe: risk and response (2004), is that of abrupt global warming. the climate equilibrium (like the economic equilibrium, as we have discovered) is unstable, in part because of feedback effects. for example, as the alaskan and siberian permafrost melts, methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released into the atmosphere, causing surface temperatures to rise, which in turn accelerates the release of methane. and also as surface temperatures rise, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases\u2014and water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, and so increasing it accelerates the warming trend. the ocean\u2019s capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide is limited, so that as emissions increase, more remain in the atmosphere longer. similarly, the destruction of forests to make way for agriculture increases net carbon emissions because trees absorb more carbon dioxide (during the day, in photosynthesis) than they emit (at night, when they are breathing oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide). the effects of rapidly rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in heating the earth\u2019s surface could produce such catastrophes as the melting of the greenland and antarctic ice caps, which would raise the level of the oceans by several feet, and the melting of the arctic ice cap, which by diluting the salt in ",

(t is 2010, t - 1 2009, and t - 2 2008.) there will be no cost of living increase in 2010 for the excellent reason that as of the end of the third quarter of this year (september 30, 2009), the cost of living had fallen 1.3 percent from the end of the third quarter of 2008. social security has a ratchet: benefits increase when the cost of living increases but do not decrease when the cost of living decreases. there is thus nothing to \"compensate\" social security annuitants for; on the contrary, they will be receiving a windfall in 2010 by virtue of the increase in their real (as distinct from nominal) benefits: their 2010 benefits will buy more.\n\ntransfer payments, moreover, are a poor device for fiscal stimulus. the idea of a fiscal stimulus as an anti-depression device is to increase employment and by doing so restore business and consumer confidence; we are seeing today how high and rising unemployment is sapping that confidence and retarding recovery from the current depression (and it is a depression, not the \"great recession\" as some are calling it, though that's an issue for another day).\n\ntransfer payments are at two removes from putting unemployed people to work. the amount of the transfer that is saved by the recipient in a savings account or other safe haven is (by definition) not spent, and so does not increase demand and therefore supply and therefore employment. and the amount of the tra",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog the biggest problem besetting the administration's program of health reform is how to pay for it. the heart of the program is extending insurance coverage to tens of millions of people who at present are not insured. this will cost more than $100 billion a year just in subsidies, but the total cost will be higher because demand for medical services will rise. at present, people who are not insured are billed directly for medical services. often they cannot pay, but then their credit takes a hit, or they are forced into bankruptcy. and emergency rooms use queuing to increase the cost of their services to the indigent. when the uninsured become insured, the marginal cost of medical services to them falls to the copayment or deductible that they are charged; the total price (pecuniary plus nonpecuniary) is now much lower, so more service is demanded, and prices to all consumers of medical services rise because supply is inelastic.\n\nsome advocates of extending coverage argue that it will reduce aggregate medical costs. they point out that people may defer preventive care that might ward off an illness, or a worsening condition, that might cost more to treat than preventive care would have cost. the other side of this coin is that preventive care may keep alive people who would have died, thus ending their demand for medical care. but everyone dies eventually, and a very high fraction of total medical costs are incurred in the last few months of life. moreover, because of technological progress and the high value that people place on extending their life, medical expenses are growing far more rapidly than per capita income, and, as a result, postponing death imposes disproportionately greater costs on the next generation. a partial offset, however, may be that greater and therefore more costly efforts may be undertaken to postpone death the younger the dying person is. \n\npreventive care can also be very costly, especially when it takes the form of ",

(i develop this argument in my book catastrophe: risk and response [2004].) not because it would necessarily reduce carbon emissions more than a quota approach would do, but because it would stimulate research into ways of solving the global-warming problem technologically. the higher costs of energy to energy producers would create strong incentives to develop technologies that would solve the problem, including technologies for removing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, which may well be a more promising approach than trying to induce the substitution of \"clean\" energy sources for fossil fuels.

(the book is entitled a failure of capitalism: the crisis of '08 and the descent into depression , and will be published early in april by the harvard university press.)\n\nit is a bad idea for three reasons. first, it directs attention away from the really culpable parties in the depression, who are not the financiers. they were engaged in risky lending, that is true; but the fact that a risk materializes does not prove that it was imprudent. a small risk of bankruptcy--a risk that almost every business firm assumes--can be, when it is a risk faced by most firms in an industry and the industry is financial intermediation, catastrophic. but the responsibility for preventing catastrophic risks to the economy caused by a collapse of the banking industry lies with the federal reserve, other regulatory bodies, and the treasury department. a banker is not going to forgo a risk that should it materialize would wreck the economy, because his forbearance would have no consequence, as long as his competitors continued running the risk; it is a classic case of external costs, requiring government intervention. because the federal reserve under alan greenspan pushed interest rates too low and kept them low for too long, and because regulation of financial intermediaries had over the years dwindled and became especially lax during the bush administration, the bankers were allowed, and competition forced them, to take risks that could have and have had disastrous results. if the governme",

(the comparison excludes retiree benefits, a very large cost of the detroit companies, but not an hourly labor cost.) this difference may seem small, considering that labor is only about 10 percent of the cost of making a car, but many of the workers at the companies that supply parts to the automakers (and the parts represent about 60 percent of the total cost of manufacturing the vehicle) are also represented by the united auto workers. anyway, since the foreign transplants have other competitive advantages over the detroit automakers, the latter can hardly afford to have even slightly higher labor costs.\n\nwhen the auto bailout bill was being debated in congress in november (ultimately it was voted down), senator corker said that he would support the bill if it conditioned the bailout on the detroit automakers' reducing their workers' wages and benefits (to which the union would have to agree) to the level at the foreign-owned plants, as well as conform work rules to the work rules in those plants. the significance of the work rules must not be underestimated. as is common in unionized firms, the united auto workers has successfully negotiated not only for wages and benefits for the workers they represent but also for rules governing what tasks the workers can and cannot perform, how m",

(the use of the word \"recession\" to describe any contraction less severe than the great depression is a triumph of euphemism over clarity.)\n\na depression is an essential backup to efforts to moderate the business cycle. the housing bubble could not expand indefinitely; leverage could not keep growing indefinitely. the government was doing nothing to prick the bubble or to limit leverage. the longer the world economy went without a depression, the worse the collapse would be when it finally, inevitably, came. the saving grace of catastrophes is averting worse catastrophes: imagine if, instead of attacking the united states with commandeered airliners, al qaeda had waited a few years and attacked with suitcase nuclear bombs. we would not have been on guard, as we are now because of the 9/11 attacks.\n\na depression increases the efficiency with which both labor and capital inputs are used by business, because it creates an occasion for reducing slack.one might think that a firm that has slack in good times will have as much incentive to reduce it as it would in bad times; slack (failing to maximize profits) is an opportunity cost, which in economics has the same motivational effect as an out-of-pocket expense. but firms are organizations, and organizations experience agency costs, which are more difficult to control in good times than in bad. if a firm's profits are growing, it is easier for the firm's executives to skim some of the profits, pocketing them in the form of excessive compensation or perquisites, than when the firm is shrinking. in the former case, stockholders will be doing well",

(see the discussion of mandatory retirement in chapter 13 of my 1995 book aging and old age .)\n\neven if the result of abolishing mandatory retirement age is higher costs for universities, to the extent that all competing universities are affected, they will be able to shift most of the cost to students in the form of higher tuition. and to the extent that even generous buyouts are refused, universities can offset the effect by increased hiring of young faculty, albeit at increased cost. for just as higher energy costs need not alter the age mix of the faculty, neither need the abolition of mandatory retirement do so. of course, this assumes that universities want a youthful faculty. as becker points out, and i below, there is a good reason for universities to want to have a youthful faculty: young faculty tend to be more innovative.\n\nthe average age of professors has increased, but the increase may largely have resulted from factors unrelated to the abolition of mandatory retirement ages: namely, contin",

(the ordinance is rather complicated, see www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/cdp/calorie_compliance_guide.pdf, visited july 24, 2008; my summary is a simplification.) the stated purpose of the ordinance is to reduce obesity.\n\nthe ordinance will be criticized as being at once unnecessary, because information about calorie content can be conveyed without requiring that it be printed in large type on the menu (an alternative would be publication on the chain\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s website, or the posting of a separate notice in the restaurant), and paternalistic, because people concerned about their weight have the incentive and ability to inform themselves about the number of calories that they consume. the ordinance may also be ineffectual, because most people eat most of their food at home rather than in fast-food outlets; anticompetitive, because small chains will incur the same costs as large ones to certify the caloric content of their offerings; blind to the effect of competition in forcing retail firms, including restaurants, to disclose whatever information will give them an advantage in competing for calorie-conscious consumers; unhelpful, because it will contribute to information overload on consumers bombarded with all sorts of warnings; and not based on a responsible cost-benefit analysis.\n\nthese are legitimate criticisms, but they may not be conclusive. a law aimed at reducing obesity would be paternalistic if obesity did not produce external costs, but it does, because obese people consume a disproportionate amount of medical resources, and there is extensive public and private subsidization of medical expenses (private through insurance pools that are unable or forbidden to identify and reject high-risk insureds). however, the size of the externality i",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog the economic study that becker discusses treats gasoline taxes as a form of regulatory taxation, that is, taxation aimed at altering behavior rather than at collecting revenue. a gasoline tax is an excise tax, and excise taxes are a common method of raising revenue to pay for government. the best excise tax from a revenue-raising standpoint is one that causes minimum substitution against the taxed good or service, since (in the absence of externalities) such substitution distorts the efficient allocation of resources and reduces the revenues that the tax was supposed to generate. a regulatory tax aims at substitution because of the externalities caused by the taxed good or service, but complete substitution is rarely achieved (and indeed would usually be inefficient), and so a regulatory tax raises revenue as well as altering behavior. my guess is that the very high gasoline taxes in europe, which are primarily responsible for the fact that the price of gasoline in europe is on average almost twice the u.s. price, are intended and effective as revenue-raising devices, since those taxes antedate the current concerns with global warming, dependence on oil supplies from hostile or unstable nations, pollution, and acute traffic congestion. whether from a revenue standpoint a stiff gasoline tax is an efficient tax, i do not know. but my guess is that it is. since distances are shorter in europe and public transportation far more extensive, europeans can substitute against gasoline more easily than americans can; nevertheless the very high price of gasoline in europe, though for years it has been higher than u.s. prices are now, has not prevented demand for gasoline from growing, though in part this is due to extensive european construction of new non-toll highways and roads. an excise tax on a single commodity will not generate a great deal of revenue, because of its narrow base, but can be justified as part of a comprehensive system of excise taxe",

(because the population is assumed to be living at the subsistence level, the equilibrium cannot be achieved through higher food prices.) malthus did not foresee the technological advances that have resulted in a faster rate of increase in the food supply than in the population, or increases in wealth that enable food prices to rise to prevent shortages should demand outrun supply. nor did he foresee modern contraception technology, or china\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s one-child policy. but given his assumptions, his analysis is sound and it gave darwin the clue he needed to develop the theory of natural selection. in malthus's model people kill each other to avoid starvation, and those who do best in the desperate struggle survive--hence survival of the fittest as determined by a competitive process.\n\nas becker points out, paul ehrlich and others predicted in the 1970s (beginning with the first \"earth day,\" in 1970) mass starvation as a result of continuing population growth. they were wrong, in part by failing to predict the green revolution, which greatly reduced the cost of food production. the situation today is diffe",

(there is an odd exception: some christians believe that a person can be \"possessed\" by the devil, in which event he is not responsible for his actions until the devil is exorcised.) i find it hard--maybe for lack of imagination--to believe that decisions have no cause. i assume that they are determined by the balance of advantages and disadvantages as it appears to the decider, though he may not be fully conscious (or conscious at all) of the considerations that are moving him. those considerations are influenced by background, intell",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog until the mid 1960's, female high school graduates were less likely than male graduates to go to college, and female college students were far more likely to drop out than were male students. the direct reason for this difference was that many younger women married and then dropped out of school - mainly to start having families. perhaps a more basic reason for this gender difference in education was that women did not participate in the labor force so much in those days, and hence many women did not believe a college education was useful.\n\nall this has changed radically since 1970. female high school graduates are now no less likely to enter college than are male graduates, and a much larger fraction of girls than boys finish high school. these two facts imply that considerably more women enter college than men. the fraction of college students who are female is further increased by the greater propensity of women who enter college to finish and graduate. about 57% of american college students are women, and they constitute about 60% of those who graduates. similar trends toward making women a majority of college students apply to many european countries, and some asian countries as well. \n\nwhat explains this reversal from under representation of women in college to over representation ((see the related discussion in my blog entry for july 17, 2006)? one important cause is that marriage and child-rearing exert a much weaker pull out of school for women than in the past since women marry and start families at much later ages than 40 years ago. this increase in age at marriage is related to the decline in birth rates, and to the increased time that women want to spend working rather than caring for children and running households. \n\na college education is more attractive to women who spend greater time in the labor force since going to college significantly raises earnings of women as well as men. the financial attractiveness of a college educa",

(the kyoto protocol creates such a system for carbon emissions, but the united states is not a signatory to the protocol and has no cap and trade program for carbon.) in cap and trade, each polluter is given a permit to emit a certain quantity of a pollutant. the total amount permitted to all polluters will be less than the total pollution, because the aim is to reduce pollution. the key point is that the cost of compliance varies across polluters. consider two polluters. one can eliminate a ton of emissions at a cost of $10, the other at a cost of $50. at any price between $10 and $50, both polluters are better off if number one sells the right to emit a ton of emissions to number two; society too is better off, because the trade frees up $40 to invest in other goods.\n\nthe problem with carbon offsets is that they are purely voluntary. you do not obtain a monetary benefit by reducing carbon emissions, as you would if you had an emissions permit that you could sell to big emitters, or if you would be punished for exceeding a permitted level of emissions. when you buy a carbon offset, you are making a charitable contribution to fighting global warming. since charitable motivation is weak compared to self-interested motivation, carbon offsets are a poor substitute ",

(it is chapter 4 of the imf's \"world economic outlook\" published this month and available online at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2007/02/pdf/c4.pdf.) in essence, the report, while acknowledging serious data limitations, finds that average incomes have increased significantly in most nations in recent decades, but that income inequality has also increased in most nations, mainly because of disproportionate increases in the incomes of the top fifth of the populations. the incomes of the other quintiles have increased too, but not as fast, so that overall the gap between rich and poor has increased although the poor are better off--just not as better off. both the increase in average incomes, and especially the increase in inequality, are driven mainly, the report finds, by increased utilization of advanced technology, which increases the returns to high-skilled workers relative to the returns to low-skilled or unskilled ones. the report suggests that greater investment in education would tend to reduce inequality by increasing the proportion of high-skilled workers.\n\ni want to question three assumptions of the imf report. the first is that increased income inequality is a bad thing, the second is that an increase in world average incomes is a good thing, and the third is that greater investments in education are bound to reduce inequality.\n\ni do not think that increased income inequality is bad (regrettable, unfortunate, deplorable, etc.), in general (an important qualification, relaxed below), when it does not involve any reduction in the incomes of a substantial fraction of the population. suppose that over some period the average income of people in the bottom four quintiles of a nation's income distribution increases by 2 percent and the average in",

(the union cannot force the workers in the collective bargaining unit to join the union, but it can charge them an \"agency fee\" for negotiating on their behalf as well as on behalf of the union members.) the union takes a share of the monopoly gain in the form of union dues.\n\nas with any monopoly, union cartelization causes inefficient substitution, whether of capital for labor or of production by nonunionized competitors, and it also generates rent-seeking costs--the cost",

(curiously, varol's kibbutz--ein ha-shofet--was named in honor of justice brandeis, shofet being the hebrew word for judge.) in trying to weaken the bond between parents and children, the founders of the kibbutz movement, echoing plato, who in his sketch of an ideal communist state in the republic had advocated the communal rearing of children, were acknowledging that parents' instinctual desire to advance their children was inconsistent with communal equality.\n\nthe kibbutz movement is almost a century old, and it is more remarkable that 30 percent of the kibbutzim are still communist than that 70 percent are not, although the times article does not indicate the percentage of the total kibbutz population that lives in those \"classic\" communist kibbutzim or how complete their commitment to the kibbutz ideal actually is. an even more durable example of voluntary collectivist living that comes to mind is found in the catholic monasteries and convents--and notice that it is too is founded on a real",

(television viewing by americans did not increase, and may have declined, during the past 25 years.) the development of many drugs that combat high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, and other ill health caused by being greatly overweight, and a reasonable expectation of further medical progress in the future, also contributed to the declining concern about being greatly overweight.\n\nsocial networks that influence eating and leisure activities has been recently suggested as a further factor in the spread of obesity. an article in the july 26 issue of the new england journal of medicine (\"the spread of obesity in a large social network over 32 years\") analyzed the famous framingham heart study for any evidence of social influences on obesity. this study has followed abou",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog the subprime-mortgage imbroglio is just the latest chapter in an age-old concern with the charging of interest, especially to individuals. medieval christianity forbade the charging of interest on the ground that it was unnatural for money to increase (as by lending $100 at a 10 percent interest rate so that at the end of the year the $100 has grown to $110), because unlike pregnancy there was no mechanism by which an inanimate object such as money could reproduce itself. behind this superstition lay undoubtedly a hostility to commercial society, which persists today in some quarters of the muslim world; islam forbids charging interest although substitutes are tolerated. the concern with lending has persisted into modernity even in western societies. usury laws, which set a ceiling on interest rates, and the truth in lending act, which requires detailed disclosure of annualized interest rates in consumer loans, are examples of this concern.\n\nthe relaxation of usury laws--a natural concomitant of the spread of free-market ideas in american society--allowed lenders to offer loans at very high interest rates to borrowers with poor credit ratings. payday loans, which charge astronomical interest rates to persons who need money to tide them over till their next paycheck, and subprime mortgage loans sometimes at annual rates 4 or 5 percent higher than mortgage loans to borrowers who have good credit, were consequence of the relaxation.\n\ni agree with becker that credit is no different from any other commodity. for government to place a ceiling on price prevents people from buying the commodity who would be willing to pay a higher price, and thus it prevents a mutually beneficial, and therefore value-maximizing, transaction. the argument for the ceiling is that people who have a poor credit record have demonstrated their incompetence to borrow and so should for their own good be prevented from borrowing more. that is not a compelling argument, apart f",

(this is an important point; if all colleges did was separate the smart from the less smart, college would be an inefficient alternative to simple testing.) an apprentice system would be a substitute (and there is evidence that in germany it is a highly efficient substitute), but employers naturally prefer to shift a portion of the cost of screening potential employees to colleges and universities. because those institutions are supported by taxpayers and alumni as well as by students, employers do not bear the full cost of screening.\n\nthese points are consistent with higher education being a good private investment, but do not suggest that it is either a particularly good s",

(the study can be downloaded at www.pacificresearch.org.) how did the authors arrive at that figure, and is it meaningful?\n\nthey begin by estimating that the nominal (that is, dollar expenditures as distinct from social costs) annual cost of the tort system, consisting mainly of attorneys' fees and other costs of administering the system plus the amount of money paid to tort claimants in judgments and settlements, is $279 billion, of which $128 billion is the amount paid out to claimants. the estimate comes from a report ( u.s. tort costs: 2003 update ) by tillinghast-towers perrin, a consulting firm for the insurance industry, with the report's estimate updated to 2006. it is impossible to determine from tillinghast-towers perrin\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s report what the sources for most of its data are, and so the figures i have quoted must be taken with a grain of salt; indeed, so far as i can tell, they may be completely unreliable. they are almost certainly exaggerated, given the financial connection between the firm and the insurance industry.\n\nthe authors of jackpot justice know the difference between a cost, which in economic terms is a reduction in the amount of valuable resources, and a transfer of wealth from one person to another that doesn't reduce the total amount of resources but merely redistributes them. the $128 billion figure is a transfer, not a cost. but as the authors point out, the opportunity to obtain a wealth transfer can generate a cost--a cost incurred to obtain the transfer (incurring costs to obtain a wealth transfer, when socially unproductive, economists call ",

(in confining my discussion to cases of governance, i focus on situations in which, as in united air lines before its bankruptcy, or the proposed reorganization of the tribune company, the esop owns all or a controlling amount of the common stock of the corporation.) i believe that it would usually flunk the market test. granted, the esop has an advantage over the conventional worker-owned firm: the value of a firm's capital stock is the discounted present value of its expected future earnings, so that a worker who owns esop shares has, at least in his role as part owner, the same horizon as the corporation itself, rather than the truncated horizon of the worker in a conventional worker-controlled firm (a cooperative), who cannot benefit from anything the corporation does after he retires and who consequently has no financial stake in maximizing the corporation's present value.\n\nbut this advantage of the esop over the conventional worker-controlled form will usually be modes",

(for elaboration, see my book sex and reason (1992), particularly chapter 9.) especially given the large disparities in wealth in the united states, legalizing polygamy would enable wealthy men to have multiple wives, even harems, which would reduce the supply of women to men of lower incomes and thus aggravate inequality. the resulting shortage of women would lead to queuing, and thus to a high age of marriage for men, which in turn would increase the demand for prostitution. moreover, intense competition for women would lower the age of marriage for women, which would be likely to result in less investment by them in education (because household production is a substitute for market production) and therefore reduce women's market output.\n\nof course, forbidding the wealthy to buy a particular commodity is usually inferior to taxation as a method of reducing inequality. yet we do forbid the buying of v",

(the objection to permitting some athletes to cheat by using these drugs sub rosa is too obvious for discussion: that really is unfair competition. the objection would disappear if the ban were lifted.) one valid objection, which seems however minor, is that it complicates comparison with earlier athletes, who didn't have access to performance-enhancing drugs. but in many sports, such as baseball, they had an advantage denied to current athletes: black and hispanic athletes were excluded from the competition. other changes that complicate comparison between baseball players of this generation with those of earlier generations  include the advent of night baseball, natural gains in height and weight because of better nutrition, improved vision correction, longer seasons, better equipment, better orthopedic surgery, more sophisticated techniques for managing a team, and better health care generally.\n\nas becker points out, no objections are raised to athletes' improving their performance by better training, more exercise, more practice, or abstention from alcohol and cigarettes",

(on the eve of the lease, indiana raised toll rates--which hadn't changed since 1985--significantly.) two years ago chicago made a similar lease of the chicago skyway, an 8-mile stretch that connects chicago to the indiana toll road, for $1.8 billion. there is considerable interest in other states as well in leasing toll roads to private entities.\n\nthe idea of privatizing toll roads is an attractive one from an economic standpoint. private companies are more efficient than public ones, at least in the limited sense of economizing on costs. i call this sense of efficiency \"limited\" because there are other dimensions of efficiency, for example the allocative; a monopolist might be very effective in limiting his costs, but by charging a monopoly price he would distort the allocation of resources. some of his customers would be induced by the high price to switch to substitutes that cost more to make than the monopolist\u201a\u00e4\u00f4s product but that, being priced at the competitive rather than the monopoly price, seemed cheaper to consumers.

(of course if the plan is a failure, it will not cost 1 percent of gdp, but that would just make it a cheap failure.)\n\neven if becker's estimate of the effect of the putin plan is correct--that it would raise the birthrate by 15 to 20 percent--that would still leave the birthrate far below the replacement level. so this expensive plan, even if successful (which is what would make it expensive), would merely reduce the rate of population decline. that rate is a function not only of the birthrate but also, as becker points out, of the very poor health of the average russian man. so if the main goal is to retard population decline, russia might ",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog the extraordinary congressional reaction to the recent increase in retail gasoline prices, though distressing to economists, is not surprising. since the latter part of last year, the average retail gasoline price has risen from slightly over $2 a gallon to $3 a gallon, largely as a result of increases in the price of crude oil. the rapidity of the increase in gasoline prices has made it difficult for many consumers to adjust by altering the amount of their driving; demand tends to be inelastic in the short run. suppose you drive 10,000 miles a year and have a modest income, say $40,000. you probably buy about 500 gallons of gasoline. if the price per gallon rises by $1 and you are able to reduce the amount you drive by only 10 percent and so buy 450 gallons, your total expenditure on gasoline will rise from $1,000 (500 x $2) to $1,350 (450 x $3), an increase equal to almost 1 percent of your income. for people of modest income, such an increase in expense is palpable. the fact that in inflation-adjusted dollars the price of gasoline is roughly the same as it was in 1949 and much lower than it was in 1982, or that retail gasoline prices are twice as high in the united kingdom (and several other european countries) as in the united states, is no consolation to these people. moreover, because people buy gasoline frequently, they are very conscious of changes in its price. and there is so much publicity about oil and so close an identification of the bush administration with the oil industry that people are primed to think of gasoline prices as having a special economic and political significance, and to suspect that increases in such prices are a result of malign influences.\n\nin fact the cause of the price spike is primarily, as i said, the increase in crude oil prices, and that increase is in turn primarily the result of rapid growth in demand for oil by china (now the world's second-largest consumer of oil) and india, a growth that has outpace",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog there is a considerable irony in the latest french riots, which are mainly by high school, college, and university students protesting a new law that allows employers to fire employees (without cause) during their first two years of employment, if the employee is under 26 years of age. the law, which has not yet gone into effect and will not if the government caves in to the rioters and their supporters (including public-employee unions, especially in transportation), is a response in part to a previous round of more serious riots, by french muslims of mainly north african origin protesting their economic situation, which includes an astronomical unemployment rate particularly among the young. (becker and i blogged about those riots on november 13 of last year.) the overall unemployment rate of the under-26 population in france is in excess of 20 percent, which is greater than that of the adult population as a whole (the corresponding rate for the united states is about 10 percent). the reason is that once hired, an employee can be fired only with great difficulty. employers are naturally reluctant to hire people, mainly young, many of whom haven\u201a\u00e4\u00f4t worked before (or if they have, it can only have been for a short time), because the likelihood that they will do a good job is difficult to assess unless they have a record of prior employment.\n\nthe youth unemployment rate is even higher among muslims in france, and they are among the rioters, which makes no sense in terms of their economic self-interest. that ethnic french youth should be rioting against a law that would help the muslims is perhaps surprising given the liberal ideology of most young people in france, yet may be, i will suggest, an expression of rational self-interest.\n\nthe youth unemployment rate is largely an artefact of french law. if employers were free to fire employees without cause, as under \"employment at will,\" the most common form of employment contract in the u.s. priv",

(in later work, gay has reduced this estimate.) as the authors point out, however, an increase in cadaver donations would presumably reduce the number of donations from living people, so the net effect on donations is uncertain. as the authors also realize (and attempt to correct for, while recognizing the difficulty of succeeding in the attempt), the adoption of an opt-out system may reflect, rather than cause, a propensity to donate organs.\n\none possible reason the weak default rule appears to have a significant effect is public ignorance. the probability that one's organs will be harvested for use in transplantation must be very slight--so slight that it doesn't pay to think much about whether one wants to participate in such a program. when the consequences of making a \"correct\" decision are slight, ignorance is rational, and therefore one expects default rules to have their greatest effect on behavior when people are ignorant of the rule and therefore do not try to take advantage of the opportunity to ",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog germany and the united states, among many other countries, have been criticized for not having the extensive system of benefits to parents who have children found throughout scandinavia and some other countries. for example, the swedish government not only heavily subsidizes day care activities for young children with working mothers, but also allows up to eighteen months of paid leave to care for a newborn child. these benefits are open to both mothers and fathers, but mothers take practically all leaves. benefits almost fully compensate for the loss in earnings during the first 12 months of leave, while they offset more than half of earnings during the next 6 months of leave. also companies have to take their employees back at comparable jobs when they decide to return to work from a child leave.\n\nthe many advocates of a swedish-type childcare system believe it permits mothers of young children to work while guaranteeing that their children have adequate childcare at government-run facilities. at the same time, it allows mothers to care for their young children without losing their jobs. in addition, these subsidies tend to encourage families to have more children since they reduce the cost of having and raising children.\n\ndespite these claims, i believe it would be a mistake for the us, germany, or other countries to emulate the swedish approach. for starters, middle class and rich families can pay for their own childcare services for young children, such as preschool programs, whether or not the mothers are working. in fact, the majority of such families in the united states do send their young children to day care programs. it is much more efficient to have better off families buy childcare services in a private competitive market than to spend tax revenue on preschool government-run programs for the children of these families. the swedish childcare system was insightfully criticized along these lines in a controversial but i believe corr",

(some gas stations are reported to have seen their profits increase by 400 percent shortly after hurricane katrina struck.) in times of catastrophe, with consumers hurting, the spectacle of sellers benefiting from consumers' distress, while (it seems) deepening that distress by charging them high prices, is a source of profound resentment, and in a democratic society profound resentments trigger government intervention.\n\nsuch intervention is nevertheless a profound mistake, and not only from ",

(this would be consistent with opposition to expanding quotas for women and minorities--such quotas favor the less skilled and so do not produce value that benefits competing workers.) the main opposition to relaxing the quotas seems to come from unions; maybe they fear that any relaxation would spread to less skilled workers. the universities, moreover, have an additional stake in limiting the quotas besides the one i mentioned in my post; as one commenter points out, foreign students, forbidden by their student visas to work at regular jobs, provide valuable research assistance to university faculty.\n\na comment about the cultural benefits conferred by immigrants suggests a partial answer to the security concerns that i expressed in my post. our intelligence system is in desperate need of more people fluent i",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog the very large increase in oil and natural gas prices in the past couple of years has led to renewed concern about whether world economic development is \"sustainable\". this term is typically not defined carefully, but sustainability requires that improvements in the living standards of the present generation should also be attainable by future generations. the concern is usually that because fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources are used to produce current economic development, future generations will have much greater difficulty in achieving equally high living standards. a related concern is that environmental damage due to global warming and other types of pollution will create major economic and some health problems for future generations.\n\nin a simple arithmetical sense, the use of some non-renewable resources in current production clearly reduces the stock remaining for future generations. but the relevant concept for development purposes is not the physical supply of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources, but the economic cost of gaining access to them. over most of the past 100 years, fossil fuel prices relative to other prices declined rather than increased, even though significant amounts of these fuels were used to help develop many nations. the reason for the decline in relative prices is that new discoveries and better methods of getting at known sources of oil, gas, and coal led to growing rather than falling stocks of economically accessible reserves. \n\nexactly 140 years ago a great british economist, w. stanley jevons, argued (see the coal question, 1865) that the world was running out of coal, which he claimed in a few decades would make further economic progress impossible for england and other nations. the book is a high quality statistical study, but even jevons failed to anticipate the use of oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, the discovery of additional sources of coal, and the extent of improvements i",

(see my opinion in wittmer v. peters , 87 f.3d 916 (7th cir. 1996).) i would go further and say that if an all-male prison wanted to hire just male guards, or an all-female prison just female guards, i would permit this, although the courts disagree.\n\n2. situations in which a private firm or other private entity practices affirmative action in response to customer preference or to ward off adverse legal action. a firm that sells primarily to blacks might want to give a preference to black applicants for sales positions or insist that its advertising agencies include black models in their advertisements for the firm's products. similarly, if a firm fears that it will be sued for discriminating against blacks, it should be allowed to favor blacks in hiring in order to reduce its legal risks.\n\nthese are situations in which affirmative action is prima facie efficient because it is being adopted voluntarily by a",

(thus u.s. companies can adjust the age profile of their workforce by early-retirement programs, which create monetary inducements to early retirement.) but this is not, as far as i know, particularly common. it seems that japanese employers have devised a system of staged retirement--partial at 60, with an appropriately small pension because the employee ",

(the sociologist erving goffman wrote about this in a great book called the presentation of self in everyday life --it is an essentially theatrical conception of human social interactions: we create a self or selves to manage our interactions with other people. i formulate his analysis in economic terms in chapter 25 of my book overcoming law (1995).) this is related to but extends my point that requiring an sec-regulated prospectus-like disclosure of all material information about a person would flood society with trivial information. it would not only be distracting, it would actually reduce our knowledge of people by preventing them from signaling through their self-presentation how their intentions, motivations, and purposes should be understood.\n\na point also made in the comments that is related but that i do not fully agree with is that people should be able to conceal information about themelves that would trigger ignorant or irrational prejudices on the part of other people. i think that in general people should be allowed to make their own judgments about other people--should be able, thus, to decide for themselves what is material information. but psychologists do correctly point out the operation of what they call the \"availability heuristic,\" which is the tendency of the mind to be seized by features of a situation that are particularly arresting though not necessarily important from a rational standpoint. so knowing that a person was hiv-positive or had had a sex-change o",

(there is also a stigma to using illegal drugs, but this might remain if the drugs were legalized; heavy drinking, though legal, is stigmatized.) these costs would be eliminated if drugs were legal. it might seem that with the drugs worth more to consumers, price would rise, but this is unlikely; price would be constrained to cost by competition, and the additional benefits of the drugs\ufffdthat is, the benefits generated by removing the costs resulting from criminalization\ufffdwould be realized by consumers as consumer surplus (the difference between what a consumer would pay for a good and the price of the good). with the good more valuable to consumers but the nominal price no higher, consumption would increase.\n\nthis point is potentially very important empirically, because the effect of crimi",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog there were a number of interesting comments. most focus either on the merits of foreign aid or on the costs of avoiding hiv-aids, and i will confine my response to these two issues.\n\n1. i agree that my statement that foreign aid is an inappropriate use of public funds requires qualification in several respects. first, it can be a way of buying allies, and from that standpoint the fact that the money is diverted to the political or economic elite of the recipient country need not be an objection. second, it can be a way of conferring utility on americans who have ethnic or religious or family or other ties to people in the recipient countries. third, it can be a subsidy to u.s. industry if the aid is conditioned on the recipients\ufffd using the money to buy u.s. goods; in such a case the net transfer to the recipient nation may be small. fourth, as in the case of the indian ocean tsunami, it can be a form of social insurance. it is also possible that such aid can confer utility on the populations of the donor countries because the plight of the victims of the tsunami triggers altruistic sentiments in those populations, and that emergency assistance, being temporary, is somewhat less likely to be appropriated by the ruling elites of the recipient countries.\n\nperhaps most foreign aid can be assigned to one or more of these four categories, and only the third seems especially questionable from the standpoint of economic welfare. but when people criticize the wealthy nations, especially the united states, for being chintzy when it comes to foreign aid, they usually are not thinking about any of the above categories of foreign aid; rather, they want general wealth transfers to poor countries. and that is what i criticize, since the basic problem of poor countries is not that they are poor, but that they are badly managed; and being badly managed they are unlikely to benefit from handouts. our present level of foreign aid may be adequate to satisfy the f",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog i am impressed by the very high quality of most of the comments and by the lively exchange among the commenters. if our blog can stimulate such exchanges, it is a success already. i will limit my response to a few recurrent themes in the comments.\n\none, a minor point, has to do with my having said, all too cryptically, that \"the essence of self-defense is striking the first blow against your assailant.\" readers thought \"self-defense\" should be replaced by \"offense.\" i was thinking of the defense of self-defense in criminal law: if someone is about to stab you and you could prevent him from doing so by shooting him but you decide not to do so because you would be guilty of murder, then you have misunderstood what self-defense means in the law.\n\na major theme in the comments is that it is impossible to assign a numerical probability to an adversary's attack, unless the attack is imminent. that is true. no one could have said in 1936 that if hitler  was allowed to reoccupy the rhineland, there was a .__ probability that he would eventually attack france. however, we frequently have to act under conditions of profound uncertainty. it would be paralyzing to suggest that we should never act unless we can quantify the expected benefits and costs of our acts (there would be very few marriages under this approach). and readers who doubt that cost-benefit analysis can be applied to matters of life and death, such as war, should consider that lives are on both sides of the balance. if a preventive war that killed 10,000 people could prevent a nuclear attack on the united states that would kill 10 million people, such a war would in my opinion be justified. (i wonder how many readers actually disagree.) my 1936 rhineland example was misleading in the following respect: horrible as world war ii was, the 50 million killed and the untold destruction and immiseration caused might be dwarfed by what a small nation or even a terrorist gang--perhaps even a biolo",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog response  to commentary on preventive war-becker\n\ni am gratified by all the responses, negative as well as positive, to my short commentary on preventive war. i do not have the time to respond to individual responses, so i will be brief and make only a few general points.\n\n i was accused of not using economics, neglecting the costs of preventive war, and a variety of other errors and omissions. some of the comments are well taken, but let me restate my argument in a slightly more formal way, although i will still avoid equations. when threatened by an adversary, the options are either to preemptively attack, wait to retaliate until attacked, or wait to accumulate better information before deciding whether to attack preemptively. the theory of deterrence argues that the threat of swift, powerful, and credible responses can often deter crime and other aggressive acts.\n\ni do very much believe in the power of deterrence-indeed, i contributed to the development of the modern theory of deterrence. however, the point of my piece it that deterrence is less powerful now as a tool against certain enemies than during the cold war when the adversary was a single major state. the reason is that some of the threats now come from irresponsible nations states with powerful weapons, as well as from terrorist groups that can also acquire these weapons. these groups are not easily deterred because they are dispersed, often operate in small groups, and increasingly will get access to more and more powerful weapons. moreover, some terrorists and their leaders do not care if they die as long as they inflict sufficient damage on their enemies, and dictators of rogue states are willing to sacrifice many of their subjects if they can obtain advantage by attacking other states and groups.\n\n the third option- waiting for additional information-is part of what economists call the \ufffdoption value\ufffd of delaying. unfortunately, it is often difficult to know how long we should ",

    "searchText": "the becker-posner blog these were a fine set of comments, and let me reply briefly to some of the major points made.\n\none interesting suggestion is that a tax limited to net emissions would create a private market (contrary to what i suggested in my post) for devices for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. a power plant, say, would willingly pay a license fee for such a device if the fee were less than the tax savings from being able to offset the plant's emissions by carbon dioxide that the device removed from the atmosphere.\n\nanother commenter points out, correctly but misleadingly, that water vapor in the atmosphere blocks more heat from the earth's surface than carbon dioxide does. that is true. but an increase in atmospheric temperatures brought about by an increased atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide increases the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere (because warmer air holds more water), and thus has a multiplier effect. it is also true but, to me at least, not reassuring that climate has fluctuated a great deal in the course of the earth's activity quite apart from any human influences on climate. i am not reassured because a human-engendered increase in  global temperatures could coincide with and reinforce a natural increase, rather than offsetting it.\n\nin this connection, i emphasize the possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect. becker discusses the underlying problem in terms of multiple equilibria. a less technical way to describe it is in terms of tipping, feedback, or a \"vicious cycle.\" for example, higher atmospheric temperatures cause melting of the permafrost in alaska and siberia, which releases methane (stored in great abundance in permafrost), which causes a further temperature rise, which causes more melting and so more release of methane.\n\nthe fact that severe climatic effects might unfold quite rapidly is a reason not to be comforted by the argument that, after all, the earth might be better off if it were warmer--green",
