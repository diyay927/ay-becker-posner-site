<p class="MsoNormal">In determining whether governments should use their
monopsony power-defined well by Posner- to reduce drug prices, it is essential
to distinguish between generics and drugs that are still protected by patents.
Generics are produced under competitive conditions because they typically
become available only after patents on drugs expire. The production of generics
would be inefficiently low if the government used its buying power to force
down prices to the government, and to patients, to levels where demand for
drugs by patients exceeded the supply of these generics.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even a government monopsonist can avoid causing such an
inefficiently low output of generics if it bought generics at competitive
prices, but required generic drug producers to give them upfront payments in
order to get their business. This is called two-part pricing in the literature
on monopoly pricing, and applies fully not only to government monopsonists, but
also to unions that set wages along with employment of their members. However,
successful two-part pricing is delicate to achieve, and if used unwisely on
generic producers it could force some of them out of business in the long run
because they cannot obtain a decent return on their capital investment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The wisdom of the government’s using its economic power to
lower the prices of drugs it buys is even more questionable for drugs under
patent protection. The whole purpose of patent laws is to give drug innovators
monopoly power for a period of time in pricing their drugs in order to
encourage the R&amp;D research that leads to these innovations. The government
would be taking away with one hand what it gave with another hand if it then
used its buying power to take back some of this pricing power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A different version of two-part pricing might help even with
patented drugs. The government could arrange to pay producers of patented drugs
a certain amount upfront if they sold units of the drugs to them at the cost of
producing these drugs. Such upfront payments would help offset the large
spending on R&amp;D required to discover successful drugs. The major difficulty
in this approach is in determining the size of these upfront payments to drug
companies, especially when the media and members of Congress would be quick to
claim a sell out to powerful drug lobbies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One reason why companies and researchers in the United
States are greatly overrepresented in the development of new diagnostic and
therapeutic drugs compared to say Europe (see, for example, the paper by
Whitman and Raad “ Bending the Productivity Curve: Why America Leads the World
in Medical Innovation”, November 2009, Cato Institute) is that prescription
drug prices are about 50% higher in the United States than in Europe. Another
factor is that almost half of all pharmaceutical sales are in the US.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Posner recognizes that especially persons under government
Medicare and Medicaid are encouraged to buy an excessive amount of drugs
relative to their medical needs because their co-payment rates are only a
fraction of the total cost to the government. Posner also believes that
advertising and other promotion of drugs induce consumers to buy more drugs
than they really “need”. Perhaps that is true, although I am doubtful. Stil, both
these considerations suggest that the government should force consumers to pay
more for drugs under Medicaid and Medicare. Higher consumer prices could induce
consumers to eliminate any “excessive” use of drugs. Whether the government could
politically get lower prices from pharmaceuticals and yet force many consumers
to pay more is surely questionable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A different reason why investments in developing new drugs
may be excessive is that it is hard to deny the use of new drugs once they are
developed, even when new drugs are only slight improvements over existing
drugs. The difficulty in denying their use may arise from political pressure by
the elderly and others who benefit, even if only by a little, from the new
drugs. In addition, children who help their elderly parents pay for their
medical care may feel “guilty” in not allowing them to consume the latest
drugs, even when they add little to their parents health and longevity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Other considerations, on the other hand, suggest that drug
companies may not spend enough on developing new drugs. One is that even
elderly people appear to be willing to pay a lot of their own resources for
small extensions in their life- see the various Rand experiments on demand for
medical care. Persons with serious diseases believe or hope that if they can
extend their lives even for a short while, new drugs will come along that will
greatly improve their life prospects. This happened during the 1990s for persons with Aids since Aids cocktails developed then that greatly extended lives of persons with Aids. Very sick patients with these expectations would be willing to spend a lot for relatively small
initial extensions in their life expectancy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Another reason why too little may be spent on developing new
drugs is that companies with blockbuster patented drugs collect only a fraction of the total benefits to patients, despite the high
prices they charge. This is partly because similar drugs are often developed prior to
the expiration of the patents of the original drugs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The net outcome of all these forces is that the American
government would be unwise to use its economic power to force down drug prices,
unless it used sophisticated forms of two-part pricing of drugs. I believe that in
the long run major drug discoveries lower rather than raise medical spending by
reducing the need to rely on lengthy hospital stays and expensive surgeries to
treat serious diseases.</p>
