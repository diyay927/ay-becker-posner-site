<p>During the height of the Great Depression in 1935, with
unemployment rates around 20%, the US introduced a social security system that
made taxpayer-funded income available to workers if they retired at age 65 or
older. This was combined with a tax on the earnings of employed persons that
was supposed to finance the incomes to retirees. The purpose of the system was
partly to get older workers out of the labor force so that more of the then scarce
jobs would become available to younger workers.</p>
<p>At the beginning, this system was not expensive since
retirement payments were not generous, life expectancy at age 65 was then around
12 years, and coverage of the working population was quite limited. All this
greatly changed during subsequent decades. Social security retirement
incomes have risen greatly, partly due to highly generous adjustments for
increases in the cost of living. In addition, the average person who retires at
age 65 now lives for about 19 years, because life expectancy after age 65 has
increased greatly.</p>
<p>An even larger source of the increased cost to taxpayers of
benefits provided to older persons is the introduction of Medicare in 1965 that
provides expensive medical care for men and women over age 65. Social
security retirement income and Medicare-financed health care have become a
major part of spending: they are about 8% of GDP and 1/3rd
of the federal budget. These shares will rise greatly during the next couple of
decades unless major reforms are introduced into these programs.</p>
<p>One obvious reform would be to raise the age of eligibility
for both social security income and Medicare benefits. It is surprising that
while life expectancy of older persons has been growing rather rapidly for the
past several decades, and jobs have become less physically demanding, actual
retirement ages have declined from the 1930s. The average age of retirement is
now under 65 (about age 64) because a significant fraction of men and women
take retirement at age 62 when workers first become eligible to receive social
security retirement benefits.</p>
<p>In light of the increase in life expectancy after age 65 and
the decline in physically demanding jobs, it would be reasonable for the
eligibility age for social security to rise to 68 or 70. The average age of
retirement from the labor force for Japanese males is already only a little
below 70, which shows that much higher retirement ages is feasible. Persons who
are physically or mentally incapable of working would then opt for disability
status. This is a rapidly growing category in most developed countries, despite the
increase in physical and mental health of older persons, because of a weakening of qualifying standards. With more flexible labor markets for the elderly, such as
reducing the fear of companies that they will be sued for discrimination
against older workers, older men and women could retire from more demanding
jobs, and take jobs that are less taxing. This is what happens to older men in
Japan.</p>
<p>An increase in the average retirement age from 64 to 68
would save about 20 percent in social security payments since the average
number of years in retirement would be cut by about 20%. Similarly, an increase
in retirement age to 70 would save about 25 percent in social security
retirement benefits. Either change would also add significantly to revenue from
social security taxes since workers would be employed for several additional
years. Therefore, such increases in age of eligibility for social security
benefits would go a long way toward solving the looming social security
financial “crisis”.</p>
<p>Once a later age of retirement was introduced, it would be
much easier to raise the age of eligibility for Medicare benefits. The great
majority of older workers would be covered by their employers’ health insurance
plans, and would continue to receive the health benefits provided by these
plans. Coverage of workers in their later 60s would add to the cost of company
plans, but not by extraordinary amounts since medical spending by the average
person between 65-70 (in good part under Medicare) is only a little more than
10% greater than that of persons aged 60-65. Moreover, spending on
health care by older persons is lower under private plans than under Medicare
because the greater deductions and co-pays in private plans induce individuals
to economize more on their medical spending.</p>
<p>The savings in public health care spending from a higher age
of of eligibility for Medicare and social security benefits would not be as
large a fraction of Medicare spending as of spending on social security since
per capita spending on medical care gets much larger as people get into their
70s and 80s. Still, it would make a sizable dent in Medicare spending.</p>
<p>Higher ages of eligibility for social security and Medicare
benefits alone would not solve the looming entitlement budgetary crisis.
However, they would make big contributions toward the solution without
requiring radical changes in the level of benefits received by eligible
persons.</p>
