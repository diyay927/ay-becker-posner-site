<p>The media and many intellectuals have greatly criticized the
large growth in inequality during past 30 years in countries as different as
the United States, China, and Brazil. Yet people in all countries generally accept,
and usually admire, differences in incomes and wealth that they believe result
from abilities and hard work, and where the work done by the wealthy is
considered socially valuable. For example, the great wealth of a Steve Jobs or
Bill Gates is little criticized because they were brilliant at what they did,
and they added a lot to social value. On the other hand, objections are raised
when high incomes and wealth are considered to be undeserved. The distinction
between deserving and undeserved wealth is crucial in the degree of acceptance
and hostility to inequality.</p>
<p>Government policies that favor some individuals and
discriminate against others are the biggest source of contrived inequality. For
example, the Russian oligarchs are criticized because much of their wealth came
from government favors when Russia privatized many industries after the
collapse of Communism, and also from subsequent favors as the Russian government
consolidated ownership in natural resource and other industries. Similar
government help propelled the Mexican telecommunications giant, Carlos Slim, to
become the wealthiest person in the world.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently, all countries simply gave spectrums
for telephone services, radio and television transmission, and mineral and
energy rights to politically powerful companies. Economists pointed out that
this was granting enormous wealth to these companies without getting much in
return. Their writings and other pressures finally forced the US and many other
(but not all) governments to auction off such valuable and scarce property.
Tariffs on goods like sugar and ethanol, and subsidies to the oil and other
industries, artificially raise the incomes of capital and workers employed in
the protected industries. </p>
<p>In labor markets, China’s sharp restrictions on rural
migrants obtaining residency in urban areas has contributed greatly to
China’s rapid growth in inequality during the past two decades. Minimum wage
laws raise the incomes of low skilled workers who can find jobs, but they lower
incomes of equally productive workers who are made unemployed because these
laws price these workers out of employment.</p>
<p>I could give many other examples of government creation of
undeserved inequality, but governments are not the only source of such inequality.
Unions raise the wages of workers in the sectors unionized, but unions also
lower the wages of equally productive workers who are forced out of these
sectors into lower paying jobs elsewhere. In addition, unions artificially
reduce inequality by suppressing earnings of more productive union members, so
that the net effect of unions on inequality is not clear. One blatant example
of unions suppressing earnings of more productive members is given by the
teachers union’s opposition to merit pay for good teachers, even though good
teachers have large positive effects on their students. </p>
<p>Private monopolies and cartels tend to raise the wealth of
businessmen and workers who gain from the higher prices created by monopolies.
The burden of these higher prices is borne by consumers, other businesses, and
by the workers who must exit monopolized industries because of the cuts in
output that create the higher prices.</p>
<p>Differences in education and other human capital are the
cause of much of the earnings inequality within rich countries, such as the US
and Japan. The boom in the returns to higher education during most of the past
30 years has widened earnings inequality greatly by sharply increasing the
earnings of persons with at least a college education, and earnings also of
other highly skilled individuals. Higher earnings of skilled persons is not a
problem per se for most people, but they object to the fact that many young men
and women with the talent to benefit from higher education are prevented from
doing so. Their families and schools do not adequately prepare them for
college, and they do not have the family resources that enable them to pay for
a college education. </p>
<p>The effects on children of broken families and uninterested
parents are considerable, yet much more can be done on other dimensions to
reduce the inequality in opportunities to attend college. Preparation in
schools attended by poorer children can be improved by increasing competition
among schools, by paying very good teachers much more than average teachers,
and by getting rid of the bad and uninterested teachers. Student loans might be
made more effective by making the amount to be repaid contingent-up to a point-
on the incomes of those who are repaying student loans. This would reduce the
loan burden to those who turn out to earn relatively little, although this
“tax” on high earnings does affect the type of occupations students with large
loans choose, and may make student loans less attractive to students planning
to go into high earning fields like business or medicine.</p>
<p>The huge earnings and great wealth accumulation of some
members of the financial sector are often viewed with suspicion because they are considered more due to luck than to abilities. This suspicion is not universal since the
billionaire Warren Buffett, the second wealthiest person in America, is very
much admired, even though he made his enormous fortune from investments in
companies. The vast wealth of some hedge fund managers, on the other hand, is
often criticized in part because it is assumed to be due to good luck rather
than great skill. Usually overlooked is the role of these funds and other
investors in arbitraging prices and returns in different sectors. Hostility to
high earnings in the financial sector has greatly increased during past few
years because of the role of banks and other financial institutions (along with
governments and other culprits) in generating the financial crisis that so
damaged the world economy.</p>
<p>Since Rousseau, many intellectuals have been opposed to
inequality per se. Most people, however, distinguish deserving from undeserving
inequality. Clearly, much of the income and wealth inequality in any country
would be considered deserving because it results from greater abilities and
dedication. Yet a considerable fraction of the inequality in most countries
would be considered undeserving. Governments are expected to reduce
these obstacles, but unfortunately, governments also create many of the
undeserved sources of inequality.</p>
