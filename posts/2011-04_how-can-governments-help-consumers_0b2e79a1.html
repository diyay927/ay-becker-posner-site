<p>The new rulings announced by the Department of Transportation to force airlines, among other things, to return the fees for checking baggage if the baggage is lost, to post full prices including taxes, and to raise the compensation for being bumped involuntarily from flights, are not very onerous to airlines. However, they do add to the many rules that already require airlines to post various prices, to compensate passengers for bumping, and to engage in other behavior that is supposed to protect passengers. The new and old rules regarding passengers, and many rules of behavior imposed on companies in other industries, such as the so-called consumer protection components of the Dodd-Frank law on financial regulation, all reflect a fall in government confidence in the ability of consumers to make reasonable choices.</p>
<p>I believe this lack of confidence greatly underestimates the capacity of the great majority of consumers to make forward-looking choices in their own interests. It also underestimates the degree to which the forces of competition protect consumers against the consequences of the bad decisions they do make. I briefly defend each of these claims.</p>
<p>Low cost airlines that provide cheap tickets and minimal services grew rapidly after the deregulation of airlines that began in the 1970s allowed the entry of new airlines. Their growth shows how sensitive passengers are to price, and how many are willing to exchange lower prices for fewer services, such as no meals, or no assigned seats. Southwest Airlines started only in the 1970s after facing much opposition from regulators, and it is now the largest American airlines in terms of domestic traffic.</p>
<p>Or consider whether most passengers know that many airlines now add separate charges for checked baggage, even though these charges are often not displayed prominently in advertising or in passenger contracts with airlines. It is obvious from the fact that many more bags are being carried onto planes since these changes went into effect (and thereby delaying the departures of planes) that many passengers both know about these new checked bags fees, and they have responded to them. For those who may be ignorant of these fees, Southwest Airlines constantly reminds consumers in their advertising (“bags fly free”) that they are one of the few airlines that do not charge for the first or second checked bags.</p>
<p>This is not to deny that some passengers are ignorant of the separate charges for baggage and food, do not realize that sizable taxes add to the full cost of airline tickets, forgot about frustrations due to long and unpleasant flight delays, and are unaware of other aspects of the full monetary and psychic cost of flying. However, if significant majorities of passengers are reasonably well informed about full prices of tickets and other aspects of the flying experience, their behavior helps protect the ignorant passengers. For airlines usually have to make their pricing and other decisions on what the clear majority of passengers know and respond to since they usually cannot separate the more active customers from the passive ones. If that majority is responsive to charges that are not prominently displayed, to taxes, and other aspects of the total cost and experience of flying, airlines will tend to keep prices and charges lower to all, including the more ignorant flyers.</p>
<p>Competition among airlines may be an even greater protection for uninformed consumers than the behavior of reasonably well-informed and responsive consumers. As Posner indicates, if government regulations impose costs on airlines, ticket prices will tend to rise since airlines have been struggling for decades just to earn a decent return on their capital.</p>
<p>Suppose, to illustrate the effects of competition, that one airline discovers its profits increase when some of the costs to passengers are placed in small print on the passenger ticket contract because enough passengers act as if they are not aware of the costs found in small print. Then other airlines competing for passengers will copy the first airline, and also put these costs in small print. Furthermore, their desire to get more of the now more profitable passenger business will induce them to reduce prices on other dimensions of travel, or add to services, such as providing assigned seats when seats were not previously assigned, or adding individual videos for each seat. The end result will be that competitive pressures that lower prices or increase services to passengers will help compensate passengers who do not recognize the costs in small print, although to be sure they may be only partially compensated.</p>
<p>So I clearly agree with Posner that the new regulations imposed on airlines are mainly a mistake. They add to the costs of airlines and to the costs of flying in the mistaken belief that most consumers are easily tricked by airlines. Beyond that, the regulators fail to see that competition is the most effective way to protect even ignorant consumers from the consequences of their ignorance. The competitiveness of the airline industry is evident from the many new airlines that have entered and existed this industry during the past 30 years, and from the low profits during the decades after deregulation. Encouraging competition in this and other industries is the only really effective way to help the great majority of consumers, including ignorant and easily fooled consumers.</p>
