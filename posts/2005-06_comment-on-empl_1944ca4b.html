<h2>June 20, 2005</h2>
<h3>Comment on Employee Health Insurance--BECKER</h3>
<p>I agree with Posner that companies should not be forced to provide health insurance for all their employees since some employees may not want such insurance--for example, they may get it from a spouse. I also agree that co-payments should be required from employees since otherwise they have a strong incentive to use excessive medical care. Some of the older companies with generous health insurance plans, such as those in the automotive sector, now face staggering health expenses, in part because their plans had negligible co-payments by employees. </p>
<p>However, even employee co-payments of 10 or 20 per cent--which is at the high end--may not provide sufficient incentive for them to economize on health spending. An important improvement is health savings accounts (HSA), which were authorized by Congress in 2003 for everyone not on Medicare who has a health plan with high deductibles, such as $1000 for an individual and $2000 for a family. A family can make an annual tax-free contribution to its HAS that cannot exceed its deductible on its health plan, and is subject to an upper limit-- in 2005 the limit for families is $5250. If in any year they spend less on medical care than they put in, they can carry the balance forward, and invest the remainder on a tax-free basis until age 65. </p>
<p>No further contributions are allowed once a person reaches age 65 and usually enrolls in Medicare. Remaining balances on an HSA can then be used as a retirement annuity. This annuity is taxed without penalty as resources are withdrawn for spending on non-medical expenses.</p>
<p>HSAs provide a strong incentive to economize on medical expenses in any year since unspent amounts can be carried forward to future years when possibly more important medical problems arise. They can also be carried into retirement and used as a supplement to retirement income. As a result, HSAs give families a much stronger reason to scrutinize whether various medical expenses are really necessary since they would be trading off present care for future care and other future benefits. </p>
<p>Although co-payment medical systems also provide some incentive to economize on spending, most of the additional expense would be borne by the medical insurer, such as his employer, HMO, or insurance company, since the co-payment rate is a fraction of the total. HSAs provide stronger incentives to use medical care efficiently because all dollars saved today by the insured can be used for medical care in the future.</p>
<p>Since an HSA requires a large deductible, they are best when combined with a form of catastrophic insurance; that is, medical insurance that pays only for large, expensive, and unusual medical problems. For this reason, and to cut down free riding by the uninsured on taxpayers, I believe everyone should be require to have catastrophic medical insurance--with the very poor covered by Medicaid. The premium on such catastrophic coverage might be allowed to be deducted from taxable income, the way HSA contributions are.</p>
<p>Although employers are increasingly providing HSAs, families that start them on their own would receive the same tax benefits as when they are provided by employers. The United States' system of employer provided health care is not the usual one in most of the world. It was given a boost during World War II because employers could offer this "fringe" benefit to help get around controls over wages during a tight labor market with strong competition for a limited pool of labor. It remained afterwards because the growth in income tax rates gave an increasing advantage to any system that allowed premiums for health insurance to be provided tax-free.</p>
<p>Prior to the passage of the 2003 law on HSAs, individuals and families who purchased health insurance on their own were at a disadvantage compared to employee health insurance since they could not deduct their health insurance premiums unless they itemized their medical expenses. This advantage explains why employers provide the vast majority of health plans for persons of working ages.</p>
<p>But now an HSA provides an alternative that allows tax-free contributions to medical accounts that can be independent of employment. An HSA combined with catastrophic health insurance provides a very good system of health coverage. Catastrophic plans also need not be taken through an employer but could occur through a fraternal organization, church, professional association, or other group that gains the economies of administrative scale from group coverage, and can average risks of serious illness among different members.</p>
<p>The establishment of HSAs provides an opening wedge into removing the special privileges granted to employer provided health insurance. The next step would be to remove the tax advantage from all employer plans except HSAs, and except perhaps catastrophic health coverage if contributions to non-employer catastrophic plans are also tax-free.</p>

<div id="c061076">
<p>Two quick points. First, the argument that requiring employers to provide health coverage to all employees will end up being bad for the employees was convincingly made by Mr. Posner. The economic incentives are all wrong. It seems to me that the solution to this problem is that old bugaboo, single-payer health care. Employers would then stop paying for health care for their employees, and the incentives would be quite straighforward. I also liked Mr. Becker's argument for HSAs. They definitely improve the incentives for patients to be responsible for their health in ways the current system doesn't. I live in New York State (Queens), and have good health insurance. My girlfriend, however, is self-employed, making around $25K, and can't afford a standard HMO individual plan. A high-deductable plan and an HSA would be great for her. Except... New York State law prohibits insurance companies from offering useful high-deductable plans to individuals! See: http://www.ins.state.ny.us/cl04_04.htm . And no, we're not moving to New Jersey...</p>
<p>Finally, I'm curious how our esteemed hosts would view some of the suggestions on how to fix payments to doctors so that health, not procedures, are profitable?</p>

<div id="c061077">
<p>The argument hear lays out quite clearly the rationale for HSA accounts. However, there is a critical piece of data missing from the analysis. That is, what portion of medical costs are connected to what we would consider catastrophic care? I don't know if Medicare provides data on spending by individuals to this level, as it is a nice large dataset, but even without it, we can be confident the percentage is quite large. Given that nearly every proposal for consumer directed health care, whether HSAs or other similar ideas, proposes to include catastrophic coverage without requiring a significant portion paid by the recipient, these proposals fail to make a substantial dent in the problem of rapidly rising health costs. When I am in the ambulance with a heart attack, I am not going to get a comparison on rates. Not only am I going to demand the best care as I near death regardless of who pays, I am doubly unconcerned with the cost because I am certainly not going to pay it, as the costs will be part of my catastrophic coverage. 
<p>
Michael Porter at Harvard Business School has done some interesting thinking on a strategic framework for the healthcare system as a whole. While (as he admits) it is not complete nor simply implemented, his focus on improving access to data on outcomes in order to drive competitiveness is compelling. The competition in healthcare cannot take place on a cost comparison, as it neglects the importance of successful outcomes, and, as shown above, fails to seriously tackle the cost problem.
<p>
I continue to be resigned to a single-payer solution, although it remains a bad option, it is far better than any other.

<p>HSAs? Please. How much *extra* money would you have to have available to put into these accounts to make a difference if a real health care crisis hit you? Why do I say this and apparently ignore the catastrophic insurance that Becker discusses? Because it's utter B.S. when you look at how things really work as opposed to the conservative ivory tower that Dr. Becker lives and thinks in. Here's how it would really work fairly often.</p>
<p>Someone doesn't feel good. Goes to doctor. Spends money out of HSA for visit and tests. Tests inconclusive so more tests ordered. Spends more money. Finally has crisis, insurance kicks in but oops, after the earlier doctor's visits plus the visits earlier this year by the kids there's not nearly enough in the HSA to cover the high deductible. This is the beginning. Since he doesn't have the money the hospital turns it over to collections. It is a business first and foremost after all. He makes payments but still has his credit ruined by the past due payments. Now since in the modern world everyone wants to claim that bad credit proves something really bad about you he has a problem finding a better paying job.</p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion that every right wing economist should be booted out of the conservative ivory tower, forced to live at $8 an hour with a family to support and hopefully we could arrange for a nice case of amnesia so that they don't remember that the condition they are now living in is temporary.</p>

<p>A lot of people may start using HSA coupled wtih catastrophic coverage.  I looked into this situation already prior to your blog.  It is good I am not the only one thinking of doing this and the idea is not totally crazy.  Workers today may be more stable than employers.  For people who have job transitions, this may be cheaper than Cobra.  It also may be better in the event of some sort of catastrophic or terminal illness incurred during a transition.  It also may eliminate the worry (if applicable) of pre-existing conditions and switching jobs.</p>
<p>One problem regarding catastrophic coverage: where does one buy it?  What companies offer the best policies? (best price, insurance company that is in great financial strength)  You wrote about buying it through existing organizations.  However, this idea is new to many of these organizations, and many of them are not equipped to do this yet and may be (or are) very skeptical (new) [for example, when I told my dad earlier this year of my plans to consider buying my own insurance (catastrophic and HSA) and not enroll in future company plans, my dad did not believe I was serious].  </p>
<p>Do you know of specific organizations that currently help people find catastrophic health insurance? (an example)<br/>

<p>Thank you for the explaination of HSAs.  I was under the impression, which is apparently incorrect, that HSA's could be used as a substitute (rather than a complement) for insurance.  I am glad that is not the case, however, my worry still seems valid--that catastropic insurance will be a more suitable substitute for traditional insurance, and could therefore increase the cost of traditional insurance.</p>
<p>One would expect the healthy, not the sick, to be comfortable with catastropic health insurance.  This, unforunately, would seem to worsen the situation for the privately insured who are chonically ill because the healthy will substitute catastrophic coverage for regular coverage because of the incentives HSA's provide.  This would seem to hasten the spiraling cost of private insurance which Posner alluded to in his post.  Just a thought.</p>

And please spareme the bromides about patient sducation.Is there actually a patient who doesn't know to watch their weight,not smoke and exercise regularly?Itisn't a lack of knowledge that is driving the lifestyle illnesses.If I knew how to get patients to change their lifestyle,I'd be richer than Bill Gates (or Warren Buffet if he's currently richer)Now a little economics.Statins have the same cost regardless of dosage.Crestor given as a 40 mg tablet with instructions to take a half pill on alternate days($21/month),a beta blober daily($8)/month) and a baby ASA /day($1/month)decrease cardiac/stroke risks by over 50%.As a side effect they statistically are linked to massive lowering of certain cancers.</p>

<p>I would like Becker and Posner to tell us about the employer provided insurance they have! I know you take what you can get even if everybody cannot have it. But knowing what they have and are not likely to use would help know their policy bias. Part of the Chicago school is that individuals consistently maximize their self interest. What credability does that give policy prescriptions? How does the prescription further their interest?</p>

<p>Once again a conservative raises the bromide about the failures of the Canadian system. First, it's not as bad as conservatives try to paint it. Secondly it's only one system out of many since every country in the industrialized world has a better system than we do when it comes to publicly subsidized health care.</p>

<p>This posting\question is tangentially related to the discussion of retirement in Japan....</p>
<p>One problem in Japan may have been keiretsu- sets of companies that had interlocking relationships (management, investors, customers, etc) (see wikipedia for more).  Do you any potential dangerous, large-scale forms of keiretsu in the U.S.?  Is there any curent research on this?  </p>
<p>Keiretsu probably has some advantages.  And criticizing this might not be good for individual self-interest of a young person.</p>
