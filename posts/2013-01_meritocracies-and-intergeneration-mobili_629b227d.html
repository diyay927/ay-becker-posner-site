			Countries differ greatly in the influence of family
background on the achievements of children. Family influence is measured through the degree of intergenerational mobility, or the relation
between the achievements of parents and children. Intergenerational mobility is said to be stronger when the achievements of
children are more weakly related to the achievements of their parents.
<p>Intergenerational mobility in a country is often used as a measure
of the importance of merit rather than prejudice, political influence, and
other similar considerations in determining success and failure in that country.
Although intergenerational mobility is related to the importance of merit in
determining success, the connection is more complex than one might think.</p>
<p>Economists usually measure intergeneration mobility by the
relation between the earnings (or education) of parents and children. If
children’s (lifetime) earnings tend on average to increase by 4% when parents
(lifetime) earnings increase by 10%, the degree of intergenerational mobility would
be 60% (=(100-40)/100), while if children’s earnings tend to increase on
average by only 1% when parental earnings increase by 10%, intergenerational
mobility would be 90%. This measure of mobility ranges among countries from
about 90% to less than 20%. The degree of mobility for the United States equals
about 50%, while it seems to be over 80% for several Scandinavian countries,
and only about 30% for Brazil.</p>
<p>Success in a meritocracy depends mainly on a person’s
abilities and skills. The relation between intergenerational mobility and such a
meritocracy is complex. Consider, for example, cognitive abilities, as measured
say by IQ score. Genes are a major determinant of IQ, although early
environmental experiences and the covariance between genes and environment are
also important. The significant role of genes in IQ means that children of
parents with high IQs also tend to have higher than average IQs in part because
children inherit their genes from parents. If earnings depended to a large
extent on IQs because the economy heavily rewarded this measure of “merit”,
parents with high IQs would tend to have high earnings, and their children
would also have relatively high earnings because the children would also have
high IQs.</p>
<p>Therefore, to the extent that earnings depend on cognitive
abilities, such a “meritocracy” would have a strong correlation between the
earnings of parents and children. In other words, intergenerational mobility
would be relatively low in such a merit-based economy. To be sure,
intergeneration mobility would also be low if family position were
automatically passed on from parents to children, independently of the abilities
of children (or parents). Therefore, intergeneration mobility would be low at these
two extreme models of the role of merit in determining earnings. By contrast,
if earnings were basically randomly determined in each generation without
regard to merit or any other considerations, there would be complete
intergeneration mobility even though merit had no role in determining earnings.</p>
<p>The relation between intergeneration mobility and
meritocracy becomes still more complex after we recognize that earnings in a
meritocracy would depend not only on cognitive abilities, such as IQ. For it
depends also on investments in education and other human capital, on getting to
work on time, on being able to take criticism, and on many other psychological
characteristics. Families that are more educated and have high earnings tend to
invest a lot in their children’s human capital, and in various non-cognitive traits.
In a merit-based economy where earnings depend on the totality of abilities and
skills, children of high earning parents would also tend to be high earners
because their parents would pass on both cognitive skills and investments in various
forms of human capital.</p>
<p>Even after including parental investments in education, non-cognitive
traits, and other human capital of children, an economy where success and
failure are determined by merit would still have low intergeneration mobility.
To be sure, investments in education and many other types of human capital are
not only determined by parents, but also by government policies and by philanthropists.
To the extent that governments and philanthropists invest more in the human
capital of children with less successful parents (as appears to be the case for
governments in Scandinavian countries), a merit-based economy could have
relatively high intergenerational mobility since children from poorer and less
educated families might have high levels of human capital investments.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a big jump is still required to make
inferences from the intergeneration mobility in a country to the role of merit
in determining success and failure in that country. In particular, although the
United States has considerably lower intergeneration mobility than many Western
European countries, this does not imply that merit is a less important determinant
of success in the American economy than in these other economies.</p>
<p>Merit-based economies use the human capital of individuals
more efficiently than other economies, but a country might be willing to trade
off less efficiency for greater intergeneration mobility. Good policies would
recognize that there is such a tradeoff, and that policies that lead to much greater
mobility across generations may make the allocation of human resources considerably less
efficient.</p>
