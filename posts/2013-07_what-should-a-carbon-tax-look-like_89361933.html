<p>I agree with Posner that the evidence for global warming is
serious enough to warrant actions, and that a carbon tax is much more effective
than regulations of carbon emissions, such as those recently proposed by President
Obama. Yet even if the case for a carbon tax was accepted, and there is
powerful opposition in the United States, many issues remain about how carbon
taxes should be implemented. My discussion deals with a few of these issues.</p>
<p>Although I believe that the
evidence on global warming is sufficiently strong to warrant a carbon tax, the
magnitude and timing of the threat from warming is still an open question. For
this reason it is wise to start with a low tax rate that can be ramped up over
time if the evidence on the damages from warming becomes clearer. Economic
theory also implies that the tax should start relatively low and rise over time
even if one knew for certain that a catastrophe would occur when the amount of
CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere exceeded a certain concentration level. The
reason is that with a positive interest rate, equalization in the present value
of a tax on present and future emissions requires a rising tax rate over time.
This is an application of the so-called Hotelling Rule for optimal exploitation
over time of depletable resources, such as oil (see the extensive discussion of
the application of this Rule and other economic policies to combat global
warming in Becker, Murphy, and Topel, “On the Economics of Climate Policy”, The
B. E. Journal of Economic Analysis and Policy, May, 2011). As it were, the
remaining space in the atmosphere for CO<sub>2</sub> before disaster strikes is
the stock of an exhaustible resource.</p>
<p>In addition, research should be supported on the development
of methods and techniques to sequester and mitigate emissions into the
atmosphere of CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gases if a major disaster
from global warming appears likely. It might even be possible to develop ways
to extract some of these gases out of the atmosphere. Expensive methods of
carbon removal and extraction would be implemented only when the damage from
greenhouse gases looked to be sufficiently serious and imminent.</p>
<p>A carbon tax should not be an addition to but rather a
replacement for other subsidies and taxes on different fuels. For example, the
United States along with many other developed countries has a vast array of
special subsidies to sources of power that emit less carbon than coal, oil, and
other fossil fuels. These include subsidies for electric-powered cars, and for wind
and solar energy to generate power for electricity generation. These and other
special subsidies, regulations, and taxes designed to reduce carbon emissions
would be undesirable with appropriate carbon taxes. For these taxes would
create an incentive to find other sources of power for cars, electric plants,
and other users of fossil fuels in order to reduce their carbon footprint, and
hence the size of the overall tax bill.</p>
<p>Some groups support a carbon tax mainly because it raises
tax revenue that would be especially welcome in these times of budget deficits.
It is tempting to impose a carbon tax because of the revenue yielded beyond the
level justified by the need to cut carbon emissions, even when such a carbon
tax might have large undesirable effects on the output of gasoline,
electricity, and other goods. That is why the justification for a carbon tax
because of the threat of global warming should be sharply separated from the
desire to have such a tax to raise revenue. </p>
<p> In order to separate
the case for a carbon tax because of global warming, George Shultz and I proposed
that the revenue from such a tax be distributed annually back to the American
population a s a carbon “dividend”(see Shultz and Becker, “Why We Support a
Revenue-Neutral Carbon Tax”, Wall Street Journal, April 7, 2013). There are
several possible ways to distribute this dividend, such as through a lump sum
payment to each person with a social security number, or through a per capita
rebate. Alaska and several countries have in the past distributed to their
populations the revenues from taxes on fossil fuels. A distribution of the
revenue to the public might help blunt the strong opposition to a carbon tax because
of a belief that it would be used primarily to raise tax revenue to
finance additional government spending.</p>
<p>A tax on carbon emissions would be appropriate in light of the
real threat from global warming. However, it is important to implement taxes at
appropriate levels, and that these taxes are supplemented with the development
of mitigation and sequestering methods to reduce the emissions of greenhouse
gases if they appear to be on their way to causing major damages. It is also
important that the effect of carbon taxes in mitigating global warming be
sharply separated from the value of these taxes in raising government tax
revenue.</p>
