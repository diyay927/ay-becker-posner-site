<p>I wish to correct a pair of errors, and a misunderstanding, concerning my post on contraception and catholicism. </p>
<p>The errors: The Pope who made the 1930 anticontraception pronouncement was not Pius VI, but Pius XI. And there is some doubt whether his pronouncement should be taken as “infallible.” I am advised by a Catholic layman, Professor Stephen M. Bainbridge, that the 1930 pronouncement was not intended to be infallible. But he adds: "Although Pius XI's 1930 encyclical is generally regarded as anti-contraception, it was Paul VI's 1968 encyclical <a href="http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-vi_enc_25071968_humanae-vitae_en.html">Humanae Vitae</a> that is properly regarded as the clearest statement of the Magisterium with respect to contraception. Note that nothing in Humanae Vitae purports to be an infallible definition of doctrine. Because it has been widely accepted by the bishops and subsequent Popes, however, <em>I have no doubt that it qualifies for infallibility as part of the ordinary universal Magisterium.</em>"<em> </em>(emphasis mine). </p>
<p>A homosexual student group at the University of Chicago claims that I wrote that homosexuals are more likely to molest children sexually than heterosexuals. They misunderstood what I said. They fasten on the following sentence: "The problem of priests’ sexually molesting <em>boys </em>would be solved if priests were allowed to marry and if women could be priests, because then the priesthood would attract fewer homosexuals" (emphasis added). I didn't say that homosexuals molest children more than heterosexuals do, a subject on which I'm uninformed. I said that the problem of priests molesting <em>boys </em>would be solved (more precisely, would be alleviated, since there would still be some homosexual priests and some of them would be child molesters--necessarily of boys if they're homosexual) if priests could marry and women could be ordained. The priesthood attracts homosexuals, for obvious reasons, and homosexual child molesters are molesters of boys. Publicity concerning molestation of children by priests has focused on boys, which is why I suggested that an obvious response, though difficult for the Church because of its long-established doctrine, would be to allow priests to marry and women to be priests. </p>
<p>Women, by the way, are much less likely to molest children of either sex than men are. This means that if some (or many) priests were women, there would be less sexual molestation by priests of either boys or girls.</p>
