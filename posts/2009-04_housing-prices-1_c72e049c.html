<h3>Housing Prices and Consumption-Becker </h3>
<p>The widespread and sharp rise in housing prices during the early part of this decade in the United States and many other countries is said to have contributed to the worldwide economic boom through wealth effects that induced greater consumption. Similarly, the still steeper fall in these prices during the past few years is supposed to have reduced world consumption and helped induce the sharp downturn in world economic activity. Yet even sharp rises and falls in housing prices are likely to produce only modest wealth effects on consumption to the extent that changes in interest rates are responsible for the housing price changes (I am indebted to Kevin M. Murphy for many discussions of the determinants of housing prices and their effects). </p>
<p>Both long term as well as short term interest rates have been low since most of the period after 2001 (whether due to a deliberate low interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve or large savings by China and other Asian countries is not crucial for my discussion). These low interest rates were an important, although not the only, force behind the boom in housing prices in the United States and many other countries-e.g., expectations about future housing prices were also important. The prices of durable assets like housing are negatively related to interest rates, as long as the service flows from the durables are unchanged. Families buy houses instead of renting space mainly because they believe that ownership is a better way to consume housing services than renting. Therefore, if housing services were unchanged, the flows of utilities to homeowners over time would also be unchanged. </p>
<p>The high and rising housing prices in United States are supposed to have produced a positive wealth effect to individuals who owned homes that increased their consumption and reduced the US savings rate. Similarly, the steep drop in housing prices since 2006 is often claimed to have induced a negative wealth effect that contributed to the drop in aggregate consumption and rise in the aggregate savings rate. This wealth "loss" comes to several trillion dollars. Although these effects seem obvious and important, a closer analysis raises serious questions about the magnitude of any wealth effect on consumption.</p>
<p>Consider a very simple lifecycle and bequest story to bring out the main points. Suppose there are two periods of adult life: young and old. All young individuals buy homes at a given price that is determined by the quality of the homes and interest rates. For simplicity, for the moment I assume only one type of house quality. Older adults live in their homes until they die, and they then bequeath these homes to their children. The children then live in their inherited houses until they die, and then bequeath them to their own children. In fact, houses are the main assets that most middle class US families bequeath to their children.</p>
<p>Now introduce an unexpected fall in interest rates that increases the price of houses. Everyone who owns a home gets a windfall increase in their wealth because their homes are now more valuable. However, if they still want to bequeath their homes to their children, their opportunities to consume would not become more favorable, as long as other opportunities are not affected by the fall in interest rates. Their children in turn inherit a more valuable asset, but that asset does not bring any more housing services than before the price increase. Hence, children's consumption would also be unaffected since they simply hold their houses until they bequeath them to their children in the succeeding generation. </p>
<p>This example with inheritance of homes brings out the essentials most clearly, but the basic analysis would be unchanged if young adults were unrelated to older ones, or if they received no bequests from their parents. While older adults would then get a windfall when interest rates go down, they still have no extra resources to increase their consumption of other goods, if they want to consume the same amount of housing services. The only elderly gaining from higher home prices are those who want to downside their living space. Younger adults find housing services more expensive, so if anything they are made worse off by the higher housing prices. Yet as with older adults, the apparent change in the position of the young is largely illusionary since their houses would also be worth more after they own them. </p>
<p>More complicated analyses might produce larger wealth effects of higher housing prices due to lower interest rates. For example, higher house prices may give owners the opportunity to take out larger mortgages that help them finance purchases of other durables, including education for children. At the same time, however, higher prices make it more difficult for young persons to afford housing. Recent media reports suggest that first time homebuyers are taking advantage of the fall in housing prices to buy foreclosed and other cheaper property. Higher house prices due to lower interest rates may induce some people to substitute toward larger homes, as happened during the housing boom, and toward reduced consumption of other goods. This is because higher prices induce additional construction of houses that lowers the cost of housing services. Yet even with a substitution toward larger homes, total consumption may not change, but only its composition between housing and other services.</p>
<p>Lower interest rates may have other effects on the tradeoff between present and future consumption that do not come from the housing market. These effects would closely depend on what caused interest rates to fall. To discuss these causes would take me far beyond an analysis of the wealth effects of changes in housing prices.</p>
<p>The message of my discussion is not that higher housing prices have no wealth effects, but rather that any such effects are likely in the aggregate to be much smaller than what is often claimed. Perhaps this explains why empirical estimates of the housing wealth effect often differ greatly. It also suggests that while the rapid declines of house prices during the past few years may have had large effects on apparent wealth, it probably was not much of a drag on aggregate consumption, nor much of a stimulus to the savings rate.</p>

<p>But what if an increase in home prices can be leveraged differently - say for instance borrowing on the equity of home that magnifies a household's wealth? Wouldn't that lead to more consumption than stagnant housing prices?</p>
<p>If Prof. Becker's statement on the impact of housing asset is true shouldn't that be equally true of all assets, including rise in stock prices across the board as witnessed during the dot com boom? How is that different from the housing asset?</p>

<p>With all due respect, Professor Becker doesn't rate a "pass" here: No literature search; no data.<br/>
For those interested in such matters, try searching the Calculated Risk blog for "Mortgage Equity Withdrawal", and also look at: Alan Greenspan and James Kennedy:  "Sources and Uses of Equity Extracted from Homes" Discussion Series 2007-20, Federal Reserve Board, March 2007.</p>

<p>This would be excellent analysis if your world did exist. However, with the widespread creation and use of products designed to cash out equity you also have to examine housing's wealth effect on consumers. </p>
<p>Low interest rates increased the magnitude of the short term gain allowed by these equity products. Also, low interest rates decreased the expected return on long term investment. The double entente of low expected long term gain and heightened short term gain incentivized many consumers to cash out home equity for consumption. Low interest rates also fostered greater use of adjustable mortgage products to purchase houses, aiding an asset bubble. The confluence of enticing mortgage products made owning a home accessible to many and combined with low real returns, created a housing bubble.</p>
<p>Combine the adjustable rate mortgages with soaring asset values and low rates. Now you have the incentives, the means and the rationality for cashing out the equity in your home; prices will continue to rise. While not prudent, this was the belief many consumers were sold on. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the belief also existed that you could refinance your mortgage when the higher rates kicked in (for teaser, ARM, etc type products) using similar adjustable rate or low rate based loans. Asset value growth fostered equity cash out all the while being primed by low interest rates. </p>
<p>Furthermore, one could argue it was low interest rates that forced people into viewing housing as an investment in the first place (no other positive means of alpha). And it can be argued the low rates motivated the great securitization of low quality mortgage, debt and loan instruments. A strong contention, but financial innovation was the means to our 'end' while low rates increased the perverse incentives across the entire spectrum of agents: borrower, loanee, securitizer, investor, etc.</p>

<p>Much of the increase in the price of "homes" was in fact an increase in the price of land.  To the degree that land is a fixed asset, a higher or lower price of land is, from an economy point of view, a transfer payment with no real effect.  To the degree that the increase in the price of homes was in the form of bigger homes on more developed plots of land, the loss is the consumer surplus loss from having too much of a good.  I'm not sure the generational perspective adds much to this story.</p>

<p>Wow, for attempting to use a simple lifecycle bequest story you really botched it. If presented with an increase in wealth why wouldn't the families attempt to leverage that gain (incef was thinking along these lines too). One example of many, what if the young, who by the stories own parameters only live in one quality of house, sold the inherited house? This provides an increase in wealth greater than expected, then they can either save or consume, but more than likely both causing both an increase in consumption and an increase in wealth.</p>
<p>Of course that is the problem with simple stories, but when you don't consider what most reasonable people would do, then you weren't just telling a story.....you were using a fairy tale to back up your idea.</p>

<p>Following up on Gungabog and his reference to the Greenspan-Kennedy data.  Kennedy's (updated) data shows that homeowners withdrew $4.2 trillion in home equity in the 2000-2007 period.  Equivalent to 6.1% of gross disposable personal income.  Or almost the same amount as the amount of the goods and services trade deficit during that time -- which was $4.5 trillion.  No wealth effect????  Now mortgage equity withdrawal is effectively zero, and look what's happened to consumption.</p>

<p>         By concentrating on economics to the exclusion of all else, Professor Becker and most of the commentators miss other important causative factors that implicate land-use laws and regulations, and people's response to them.</p>
<p><br/>
          It began with the post-WW II decline in urban habitats caused by riots of the 1960s that along with "block busting" gave rise to "white flight," all of which drove city dwellers to the suburbs (with Uncle Sam ecouraging that exodus and subsidizing it with low-cost home financing, favorable tax laws, road building programs, etc.). Add to that the rise of an urban underclass, the catastrophic collapse in quality and safety of urban public schools exacerbated by bussing, an increase in urban crime rates and a corresponding decline in law enforcement (particularly in the 1970s), and urban redevelopment that became an engine of destruction of affordale urban dwellings by the hundreds of thousands per year. All that led to seeing the suburbs as the place to be, and eventually gave rise to the suburban NIMBY sydrome that inspired enactment of exclusionary ("low-growth") land-use regulations and a decline in construction of homes in the better areas.</p>
<p><br/>
          The increased demand for good suburban housing was thus met with a constricted supply in places where people most wanted to live. This caused what is now known as "urban sprawl" as developers increasingly built on the urban periphery where there were no NIMBY-shouting neighbors.</p>
<p><br/>
          Developers in "hot" markets (California being the perfect example) thus maximized their profits by building the biggest and fanciest homes they could, leading to an explosive escalation in home prices that eventually rippled downward in the housing market because of the widespread belief that to buy a good home and to keep its surroundings static was a road to riches, and that if you didn't buy it now you would not be able to do so in the future.</p>
<p> <br/>
         Add to that the Clinton administration's pressure on the banks as well as Fannie and Freddie to make improvident loans available to people who couldn't afford home owership, and what you have is a bonfire waiting for ignition. The ignition came in the form of the Fed's artificially low interest rates that created an illusion of affordability, aided by the consequences of more women entering the workforce and pooling their wages with their husbands' salaries to pay for homes otherwise beyond their ability to own. By degrees affordability ceased to have meaning because monthly payments were low and home prices were going up and up with no evident limit in sight.</p>
<p><br/>
         Voila! The bubble. </p>

<div id="c102013">
<p>Amazing to see no data or charts to support this commentary, as someone else pointed out. Makes me wonder if this was the same type of weak analysis that was conducted at the Fed, which had them leave rates too low for too long (in spite of Mr. Greenspan's absurd protestations that he was not at fault for the bubble) or contemplate raising rates as late as August 2007, when calamity was on the doorstep and not inflation.</p>
<p>Folks in Washington would do well to develop an understanding of how the real world works as events are unfolding, not in retrospect.  The core driver of the bubble, as with any bubble, was irrational exuberance, in this case about future home price growth, especially in the coastal housing markets. Excessively high home price growth expectations made real mortgage and other interest rates negative (hence our negative savings rate) and homes appear eminently affordable to homebuyers, particularly if they could get 100 LTV financing. Mortgage brokers, mortgage lenders, Wall Street and the rating agencies also signed on to these expectations, mostly because they were paid on a fee basis on volumes of loans and deals originated, and they distributed most of the risk (although they were probably sucked into the irrational exuberance as much as anyone else). Now we have negative home price growth exerting enormous stress on our consumption-driven economy (think of the -10% or so annual home price growth as the correct interest rate deflator, giving us 15% real mortgage rates - not good for a country as weighed down by debt as the US is), through credit defaults of all forms and increased savings. The stress will not relent until home prices stabilize (ie zero price growth), which eventually will happen, but perhaps not for a long while. At the same time, consumption will remain under pressure, although old habits (who doesn't love a trip to the mall) will die hard.</p>
<p>To assert that US consumption was in some way not correlated with the boom in home prices, at this late stage in the game, is obviously absurd, and way beneath what one would expect from as prestigious an institution as Hoover. It's too late to undo what has been done, but assuming the authors are based in DC, the commentary highlights another bubble that apparently persists to this day - the thought bubble of Washington.</p>

<p>Curmudgeon?  Were you trying to make a case that the poor and minorities, those who "couldn't afford home ownership" were the main cause of the Wall Street Ponzi scheme?  BTW how did you come by your handle?  Jack</p>

<div id="c102016">
<p>Try again, Jack. My point, which I thought was obvious, was that as the ripple effect spread, not only the poor and minorities, but middle class people got caught up in the frenzy. Here is an actual example well known to me, from my neck of the woods: a nice house with a view, in an upper middle-class area, sold in 1968 for $68,000. In 1980 it was formally appraised at $325,000, and in 1989 it sold within 24 hours of listing for $575,000 ($25,000 above its listing price). Even today, you would be hard put to buy it for $1.5 million. Does that make my point for you?</p>
<p>         No, these were no poor folks. The latter got screwed by the "sub-prime mortgage" thing. But this sort of thing made people we don't think of as poor, unable to buy a nice home, absent the crazy financing that kept their monthly payments lower than their loan balance required - a clearly unsustainable thing that depended on the buyers' ability to turn their homes over for more, on the "greater fool" theory. It worked, but only for a while.</p>

<p>Cur:  Thanks, but no, your example didn't do much for making your point,..... though we'd all agree that the recent run-ups were unsustainable.</p>
<p>As for "The ignition came in the form of the Fed's artificially low interest rates that created an illusion of affordability........"</p>
<p>Truth is most Fed actions do not directly affect mortgage rates. Instead........ a Fed that "eases too much" is likely to foment inflation or at min. fears of inflation which would have the effect of pushing interest rates upwards, as those buying the bonds would not want to lend long and have inflation eat up their returns.  There was MUCH more going on that influenced the "bubble" some of which I posted about under the Posner essay. </p>
<p>Ha! We DO agree that folks, poor, middle class and quite wealthy all took a screwing. </p>

<p>Jack, Of course there was much more going on. That was my original point. What I wanted to make clear was that land-use laws and regulations and their impact on the housing market had an enormous effect, even though Professor Becker did not mention any of that.</p>

Aren't the big bucks paid to accurately assess risk????  and protect the depositor's capital??</p>

<p>in an upper middle-class area, sold in 1968 for $68,000. In 1980 it was formally appraised at $325,000, and in 1989 it sold within 24 hours of listing for $575,000 ($25,000 above its listing price). Even today, you would be hard put to buy it for $1.5 million. Does that make my point for you?</p>

<p>"The message of my discussion is not that higher housing prices have no wealth effects, but rather that any such effects are likely in the aggregate to be much smaller than what is often claimed." Yes, but smaller does not necessarily mean less significant. Have you read The Power of Small ( http://tinyurl.com/d6qopb )? Sometimes it's the little things that matter the most. </p>

<p>If I bought a house for $500,000 with no money down in 2004 and it doubled in value by 2006, I would feel considerably richer. And if I mistakenly came to believe that my home's future long term price appreciation was much higher than I had initially expected, then I would not worry about spending within my means. I could live off of endless mortgage equity withdrawls.</p>
<p>Now, if the price of my home suddenly plummets back to $500,000, and looks to be heading lower, then all of my "excess" spending was misguided. I now need to massively ratchet up my savings to repair my household balance sheet. </p>
<p>We are now in the early to mid stages of a household balance sheet debt-deflation depression similar to Japan circa 1992.</p>
<p>Nominal, or even real, interest rates are not a central part of this story. Nor are future generations.</p>

<p>In pertinent part, Professor Becker writes: "The only elderly gaining from higher home prices are those who want to downsi[z]e their living space. . . .  [W]hile the rapid declines of house prices during the past few years may have had large effects on apparent wealth, it probably was not much of a drag on aggregate consumption, nor much of a stimulus to the savings rate."</p>
<p>Becker is dead on.  Retiring with too much house tends to decrease one's level of consumption in retirement.  If the value of one's home exceeds the FHA-insured limit, monetizing that excess equity by anything short of an outright sale is impractical.</p>

<p>If interest rates go down, but home prices go up, doesn't that mostly even out the actual price of the home?  In comparison to earlier higher interest rate/lower home prices times?  This last real estate boom cycle was built on artificial growth and poor money management habits.  Should we really be that surprised when the cycle went bust?</p>

<p>Jake:  Becker may be right at the theoretical, ivory tower level, but down closer to the street, I'll bet (heavily if need be!)  that oldsters with homes having doubled in price are hardly immune from the temptation to "refi", pump out a sizable chunk of equity to spend or buy a home to "flip" and sit back contented to wait for the equity to pile up again.  </p>
<p>With the younger generation being fairly successful in their own right, scattered across the nation, and perhaps having equity of their own, I suspect that the urge to pass on a paid-up or high equity home is less than it once was.</p>
<p>Ha! as for retiring with "two much house" I'd be interested in any studies showing the reluctance of CA's to "downsize" given the horrendous Prop 13 penalties of relocating within CA.  As CA's "freeways" are packed in both directions, I've often wondered how many CA's continue to live in the "wrong place" due to being entrapped by Prop 13's preferential tax rates for homes held for a long time.  Are we burning fuel, polluting the air and building "freeways" due to a greatly flawed property taxing scheme?</p>

<p>A $50,000 house worth $1,000,000. Whether one takes equity in the form of cash or sells such a house, the inflationary effects are the same in terms of creating a bubble of "percieved wealth".<br/>
THere was no real capital value there in the runup and there is no real capital loss when the bubble breaks, only the fetid odor of the bubble contents---debt and devaluation.</p>
<p>BTW, Jack is absolutely right in his observation that idiotic public policies of one sort or another have unintended and unpleasant consequences as in "We will keep your property taxes low but you can't move". Maybe even intended.</p>

<p>Jack unfortunately misses the point.  It is very impractical for a senior citizen to extract and consume equity in his home by refinancing the mortgage and further leveraging the property, since that means shouldering an increased monthly mortgage payment that must be made.  The policy issue, as Becker seems to recognize, is the tension between wealth in the form of an illiquid asset and consumption.</p>

<p>Jake: Well........... "mebbe". Depends on how "senior".  If living on SS and what's left of our retirement pensions, perhaps not.  But! if still in the workforce, as is the case for increasing numbers of "seniors" the game would be similar to those a decade or so younger.</p>
<p>The mortgage purveyor would point out the benefits of a somewhat lower interest rate, and that after deducting the interest (which would mean the "gov" paying one third or more of the stated interest rate) that the whole works would cost less than the rate of inflation. AND! you'd have a fair chunk to spend, some of which one MIGHT put by to make payments should the need arise.</p>
<p>And...... of course, as Becker touches upon (barely) a "downsizing" or moving to a sunbelt condo or far cheaper home may well be a part of the plan within a few years.  Great! the old mortgage is more than covered by the sale with enough left over for the next round.   Those who DID catch the timing did pretty well for themselves, with! as we see the new (post 2003 buyer holding a very large bag, albeit the load shared by a bank whose name is no longer part of the lexicon?)</p>

<p>"The rising housing prices in United States are supposed to have produced a positive wealth effect to individuals who owned homes that increased their consumption and reduced the US savings rate". </p>
<p>But the truth is that is not because Low interest rates increased the magnitude of the short term gain allowed by these equity products. Also, low interest rates decreased the expected return on long term investment.<br/>
