<p>The Economist in its October 2-8 issue has a cover page with the title: “How India’s growth will outpace China’s”. One of the main reasons they give for this claim in their leader on this topic is that India is democratic while China is autocratic. The other is that India has higher birth rates, and hence a younger population. Both arguments can be questioned, although I concentrate my discussion on whether democracies favor economic growth.</p>
<p>Visionary leaders can accomplish more in autocratic than democratic governments because they need not heed legislative, judicial, or media constraints in promoting their agenda. In the late 1970s, Deng Xiaoping made the decision to open communist China to private incentives in agriculture, and in a remarkably short time farm output increased dramatically. Autocratic rulers in Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, and Chile produced similar quick turnabouts in their economies by making radical changes that usually involved a greater role for the private sector and private business.</p>
<p>Of course, the other side of autocratic rule is that badly misguided strong leaders can cause major damage. Mao’s Great Leap Forward is one prominent and terrible example, but so too are Castro’s forcing Cuba into a centrally planned government-controlled inefficient economy, or Iran’s mullah-led government that created monopolies controlled by religious foundations and other groups.  The overall effect of autocratic governments is some average of the good results produced by visionaries, and the bad results produced by deluded leaders.</p>
<p>Democracies help control the range of outcomes. Visionaries in democracies can accomplish much sometimes, as did Manmohan Singh when Finance Minister of India from 1991-1996, Margaret Thatcher after she became Prime Minister of Britain in 1979, Ronald Reagan as US president during the 1980s, and Japan’s leaders after World War II. However, their accomplishments are usually constrained by due process that includes legislative, judicial, and interest group constraints. On the other hand, bad leaders in democracies are also constrained, not only by due process, but also in addition by the reporting of a free competitive press and television, and nowadays too by a competitive Internet.</p>
<p>Whether on average democracies are more conducive than autocracies to economic growth is far from well established. What is clearer is that democracies produce less variable results: not as many great successes, but also fewer prolonged disasters. Since the bad outcomes tend to produce more damage than the good ones, less variable outcomes would be an attractive feature of democracies compared to autocracies, even if democracies on average did not produce greater economic growth.</p>
<p>Comparisons between the effects of these different systems of government on economic growth are muddied by the fact that personal freedoms usually increase substantially under autocracies that have been growing at a fast pace. China is an excellent example. Although China has remained a one party autocratic system since it started growing rapidly 30 years ago, the degree of personal freedom has expanded enormously. Personal freedoms in China did not exist when I first visited there in 1981 shortly after the economic reforms had begun. Changing domiciles was virtually impossible, and Chinese men and women could not even enter Western style hotels and shops.</p>
<p>I have returned a few times since then- most recently a few weeks ago- and the contrast is simply amazing. Students and many others criticize economic and social policies of the government, including the one child policy, although they cannot openly criticize the one party government, as jailed dissidents show. Many Chinese have traveled abroad and have seen first hand the freedoms in other countries, and the Internet provides access to opinions and facts on many thousands of subjects. The government does try to censor out opinions and information from the Internet that are considered damaging to the government, but cheap software has enabled many to bypass the government censors by connecting directly to Hong Kong, which is free of government censorship.</p>
<p>Other examples of growing freedoms under autocracies include Taiwan, South Korea, and Chile. They all started their economic booms under single party dictatorships, but after a period of quite rapid growth, fierce opposition to the dictatorships emerged. Before long all these countries did become democratic, with competing political parties.</p>
<p>To return to the comparison of China vs. India, the analysis I have given indicates that it is far from obvious whether democratic India has an advantage in the economic growth race over autocratic China. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses from a growth perspective, although India clearly dominates in political and social freedoms. Yet if, and this is a big if, China continues to have effective leaders, I would give China the edge in terms of future economic growth. This edge is partly because of the enormous enthusiasm to regain its former great country position among all strata in China’s population: entrepreneurs, professionals, and workers. On the other hand, a dismal leader could come to power in China and cause considerable damage to the economy. Overall, I expect India’s growth rate to be lower but more stable, and that stability might be worth a lot.</p>
