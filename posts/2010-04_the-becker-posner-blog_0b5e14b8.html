<p class="MsoNormal">Marriage emerged as the most popular institution throughout
history primarily because it was an effective arrangement to improve the care and
upbringing of children. Marriage is not necessary to have children,
but it has been of enormous importance in the rearing of children. Birds and
other non-human species do not have “marriage”, but both parents are often
involved in raising their offspring. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the sharp declines in birth rates since 1970 in Western
and other rich countries, including much larger fractions of adults who do not
have any children, both men and women have significantly increased their ages
at marriage, and sharply raised their propensities to divorce. In 1950, a
typical woman and man married at ages 20.3 and 22.8, respectively, whereas now
the typical marital ages are 26.0 and 27.7, respectively. These changes in age at
marriage are related to reduced demand for many children, increased college
education of both men and women but especially of women, much greater labor
force participation of married and divorced women, and the narrowing of the
gender gap in earnings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are several reasons to be concerned about the below population
replacement fertility levels in all of Europe and about half the world’s population,
including China and Japan. Low fertility makes it much harder to finance retirement
benefits, medical care for the aged, and other entitlements that rely on taxing
working age populations to pay for the support of older persons. Low birth
rates in richer countries also induce increased migration of young workers from
poorer countries with large families to provide the unskilled and other young
workers that every society needs. Low birth rates lead to sex-selected abortions
in societies with a strong preference for having at least one son, as in China
and parts of India. Below replacement fertility eventually causes populations
to decline (aside from migration), which has unknown consequences for economic
growth and other macro economic and social developments. As important as these
topics are, I will not discuss them further since our subject today is low
marriage rates and high propensities to divorce, which raise distinct issues
from the effects of low fertility.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most important economic and social concerns due to low marriage rates are
the effects on rearing of children. These effects are not due to lower marriage
rates alone, but rather to the close connection between these low rates and
high divorce rates, and to the greater propensity of women to have children
without being married, or without living with the fathers of their children. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although many single mothers do an absolutely wonderful job
in raising their children, common sense and most academic findings suggest that
having a father present during the raising of children generally has a positive
effect on the development of non-cognitive traits of children. These include a
general respect for authority and reduced rebelliousness in school, and the
avoidance of gangs and other criminal activities. It also appears that the
absence of fathers has a greater effect on the non-cognitive traits of sons
than daughters, although that is a less well-established finding.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The sharp deterioration during the past 50 years in the
stability of black families in America is responsible, I believe, for much of
the continuing dismal record in school performance and in society more
generally of children from black families. When over half of all black children
are raised in families with only one parent, one can hardly be optimistic about
their development. Black leaders were highly critical of Patrick Moynihan when in
a famous report in 1965 he attributed the low achievement levels of many black
children to the absence of fathers in their homes. However, most leaders of the
black community have come around to sharing Moynihan’s views as a result of the
further deterioration in black families since his report, and the continuing poor
school performance, high crime rates, and low incomes and high unemployment of
many black children and young adults.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Children in white and Hispanic families have also suffered
from the growth in divorce rates and in single motherhood.
Children of divorced parents and other children raised by single moms generally
do worse in school, attend less good schools, are more likely to drop out of high school, and have poorer job market experiences. Although the moms
in single parent families also have lower incomes and education, I believe that
a sizable portion of the below average performance of children from single parent
families is due to their family structures.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am not claiming that children are worst off when their
parents divorce if their parents were fighting a lot, or if they had
abusive fathers. Rather, it appears that up to a significant point, children
are better off in intact families even when their families are not ideal. If
correct, this suggests a considerable gain not from encouraging marriage per
se, but from policies that encourage families to stay together. One approach is
for governments to subsidize intact families, whatever their income levels,
rather than just subsidizing families with only one parent because they have
lower incomes. Other approaches may be better, but the effects of single
parenting on the development of children is a far more important question than
the question of who can call themselves “married”, and other family issues that preoccupy the
attention of many politicians and others.</p>
