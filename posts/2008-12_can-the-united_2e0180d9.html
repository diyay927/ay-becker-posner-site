<h3>Can the United Auto Workers Survive? Posner</h3>
<p>One of the reasons for the insolvency of the Detroit automakers (General Motors, Chrysler--and Ford, which appears to be insolvent too, despite its denials) is that their workers are paid higher wages, and receive much more generous benefits paid for by their employer, than the workers employed at the automobile plants, mainly in the South, owned by Toyota, Honda, and other foreign manufacturers. The total wage and benefit bill for the Detroit automakers is about $55 per hour, compared to $45 for workers in the foreign-owned plants, and the difference is plausibly ascribed to the fact that the Detroit automakers are unionized and the "foreign transplants" not. (The comparison excludes retiree benefits, a very large cost of the Detroit companies, but not an hourly labor cost.) This difference may seem small, considering that labor is only about 10 percent of the cost of making a car, but many of the workers at the companies that supply parts to the automakers (and the parts represent about 60 percent of the total cost of manufacturing the vehicle) are also represented by the United Auto Workers. Anyway, since the foreign transplants have other competitive advantages over the Detroit automakers, the latter can hardly afford to have even slightly higher labor costs.</p>
<p>When the auto bailout bill was being debated in Congress in November (ultimately it was voted down), Senator Corker said that he would support the bill if it conditioned the bailout on the Detroit automakers' reducing their workers' wages and benefits (to which the union would have to agree) to the level at the foreign-owned plants, as well as conform work rules to the work rules in those plants. The significance of the work rules must not be underestimated. As is common in unionized firms, the United Auto Workers has successfully negotiated not only for wages and benefits for the workers they represent but also for rules governing what tasks the workers can and cannot perform, how many workers must be assigned to a particular task, the order in which workers are to be laid off (usually it is in reverse order of seniority, because older workers tend to be stronger supporters of unionization than younger ones because the latter have better alternative employment prospects and so don't worry as much about job security) in the event of a reduction in demand for the firm's products, methods of discipline, and so forth. These work rules, collectively "featherbedding," make it difficult for a firm to optimize its use of labor, and, like the higher wages and benefits that unions obtain, add to the firm's labor costs relative to those of its nonunion competitors. A December 16 blog by Rand Simberg, http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/detroits-downturn-its-the-productivity-stupid/, presents a shocking picture of how work rules impair productivity at automobile plants at which the workers are represented by the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>The goal of unions is to redistribute wealth from the owners and managers of firms, and from workers willing to work for very low wages, to the unionized workers and the union's officers. Unions do this by organizing (or threatening) strikes that impose costs on employers. For employers are rationally willing to avoid those costs at a cost (provided it is smaller) of higher wages and benefits and restrictive work rules. Because the added cost to the employer of a unionized work force is a marginal cost (a cost that varies with the output of the firm), unionization results in reduced output by the unionized firm and, in consequence, benefits nonunionized competitors. Unless those competitors are too few or too small to be able to expand output at a cost no higher than the cost to the unionized firms, unionization will gradually drive the unionized firms out of business.</p>
<p>Unions, in other words, are worker cartels. Workers threaten to withhold their labor unless paid more than a competitive wage (including benefits and work rules), but unless their union is able to organize all the major competitors in a market, the cartel will be eroded by the entry of nonunionized firms, which by virtue of not being unionized will have lower labor costs. The parallel to producer cartels is exact--workers <em>are </em>producers.</p>
<p>We are seeing this process of erosion of labor monopolies at work in the automobile industry. The market share of the Detroit automakers has shrunk steadily relative to that of the foreign "transplants" and with it the number of unionized auto workers--they are fewer by a third or more than they were in 1970. If the Detroit automakers will be forced to liquidate unless they can bring their labor costs down to the level of the foreign transplants, the UAW will be out of business either because the Detroit automakers liquidate or because, as a result of union concessions, the workers will no longer be getting anything in exchange for the dues they pay the union.</p>
<p>I don't think there's much to be said on behalf of unions, at least under current economic conditions. The redistribution of wealth that they bring about is not only fragile, for the reason just suggested, but also capricious, as it is an accident whether conditions in a particular industry are favorable or unfavorable to unionization. By driving up employers' costs, unions cause prices to increase, which harms consumers, who are not on average any better off than unionized workers are. Unions push hard for minimum wage laws and for tariffs, both being devices for reducing competition from workers, here or abroad, willing to work for lower wages. Current union hostility to immigrant workers is of a piece with the unions' former hostility to blacks and women--which is to say, to workers willing to work for a wage below the union wage. And by raising labor costs, unions accelerate the substitution of capital for labor, further depressing the demand for labor and hence average wages. Union workers, in effect, exploit nonunion workers, as well as reducing the overall efficiency of the economy. The United Auto Workers has done its part to place the Detroit auto industry on the road to ruin.</p>
<p>There is also a long history of union corruption (though not in the UAW). And some union activity (though again not that of the UAW) is extortionate: the union and the employer tacitly agree that as long as the employer gives the workers a wage increase slightly above the union dues, the union will leave the employer alone.</p>
<p>There may be, I grant, cases in which unionization reduces an employer's labor costs. If there is deep mutual antipathy between workers and employers, perhaps breaking out in violence--with strikebreakers beating up strikers and strikers beating up scabs and sit-down strikers destroying company property--there may be benefits from interposing an organization independent of the employer between employer and workers, and from creating (as the National Labor Relations Act has done) a civilized mode of resolving labor disputes. But in cases in which union organization is mutually beneficial, the employer will <em>invite </em>the union to organize its workers. I am sure the Detroit automakers would very much like to disinvite the United Auto Workers.</p>
<p>Unions do provide some services that are valuable to employers, such as grievance procedures that check arbitrary actions by supervisory employees; and union-negotiated protection of senior workers can benefit their employer by encouraging them to share their know-how with new workers, without having to fear that by doing so they will be sharing themselves out of a job. But these are measures that an employer who thinks they will reduce his labor costs can take without the presence of a union.</p>
<p>Micky Kaus, another blogger who is an expert on the automobile industry, attributes much of the problem with the UAW to the procedures that govern labor relations in unionized plants. "The problem...is the American adversarial labor-management negotiating system, in which reasonable people doing what the system tells them they should do wind up producing undesirable results. Just as negotiating over work assignments means factories adjust too slowly to generate continuous efficiency improvements (which often involve constantly changing work assignments) negotiating ponderous 3 year contracts (in which Gettelfinger [the UAW's president] must extract every possible concession to please the members who elected him) means contracts adjust too slowly to save the companies from failure if market conditions change...[T[he $14 wage scale for new hires [to which the UAW agreed several years ago] hasn't had an impact because nobody new is being hired by the UAW's employers, who are shrinking, not growing. The obvious alternative to cutting the pay of nonexistent future workers would be to cut the pay of existing current workers--but they are the people the system tells Gettelfinger he needs to please." www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/kausfiles/ (Dec. 26, 2008).</p>
<p>The unions strongly supported the Democrats in the last election and are looking for payback. I do think that there are good economic reasons for keeping the Detroit automakers out of bankruptcy until the current depression hits bottom and a recovery begins--until then the shock to the economy would be too great (see my post of November 16)--and that will keep the UAW alive for a while. But if it resists making substantial concessions to the automakers, hoping that the President and Congress will force the automakers' bondholders to make the necessary concessions or that the taxpayer will be forced to subsidize the automakers indefinitely, the union will be playing a game of chicken that may end in its destruction rather than merely in its continued shrinkage as the industry shrinks. The auto bailout is deeply unpopular with the public and the UAW's stubbornness may reinforce the impression that unions are dinosaurs slouching toward extinction.<br/>

<p>As an economist, I have a hard time explaining "featherbedding." Unions would not want to undertake wasteful featherbedding if the benefit to their members  were less than the increased wages that they could negotiate in their absence. Perhaps one could devise a coherent model where the majority of union workers (or their leaders) prefer stupid work rules to higher wages and corporations prefer the stupid work rules to higher wages as well. If so, I would like to see it.</p>

my parents, both very junior union members far more productive than their seniors, were victimized by union work rules. Senior union members, who are often less productive, prefer work rules, as they limit who can do what and who gets fired first. Essentially, increased work rules mean higher job security for some, and those are the ones who are most likely to lose their jobs. These people would prefer lower wages + job security, rather than higher wages until they're inevitably let go for younger, more productive workers.</p>

<p>An optimal contract would not have built-in inefficiencies. Instead of the scenario outlined by HH, older workers could be given a higher base salary and thereby get higher pay even if they are less productive than newer workers. So even if older workers run the union, it is not clear why they would impose inefficient work rules on everyone. In the end it is not an adequate answer to say that some set of people benefit from featherbedding. One must also show that this same set of people would not gain at least as much from an efficiently designed contract  [possibly including side payments to those gaining rents from their position of power). </p>

<p>WD40  as you must know "featherbedding" and "stupid work rules" may be in the eyes of the sidewalk superintendent and in the case of assembly line work it might not be the case at all that older workers are less productive, but in any case, all too soon younger workers become older workers and what would you do? Throw them away?</p>
<p>Also once you zoom in close,  you'll find that union work rules are based upon reason or as you intuit, they'd not have been fought for and won; indeed union guys are in favor of taking home the cash instead of impeding work flow.  </p>
<p>"Featherbedding?" perhaps, after all as pointed out there are 30% fewer UAW guys than at an earlier time with more layoffs coming; truth is the industry is "suffering" from making too many productivity gains and vehicles that last many more miles in such a short time that natural attrition isn't fast enough for the necessary downsizing.  This may be a "disease" that leaves 20% of our work force unemployed in years just ahead. </p>
<p>HH or his parents may not have attended enough union meetings to understand why they often resist turning up the speed of the assembly line but the answers are typically higher injury rates, stress problems and higher absentee rates. And again, it may be worth while to note that assembly is but 10% of the cost of the vehicle so there is little to be gained by cranking up the line speed another 10% for a theoretical gain of 1%.  </p>

<p>Posner suggests that the union did not accede to the demand that it cut wages and benefits in order for the automaker bailout.  This is incorrect.  They agreed to reduce wages over a one year period to the level of foreign competitors.  They did not agree to do it immediately.  A fair analysis would note this.</p>

<div id="c098482">
<p>I agree with Judge Posnerâs analysis.  Another way of looking at the economic impact of unions is to consider the effect of setting wages according to supply and demand in a free labor market.</p>
<p>Under those conditions, market forces will result in a worker being compensated in line with his or her productivity.  An employer cannot consistently in the long run pay compensation that is either above or below a workerâs productivity.</p>
<p>If wages are above productivity, the enterprise will go out of business after a while.  On the other hand, if an employer offers wages below workersâ productivity level, those workers will leave.  Another employer will have an economic incentive to hire those workers at a wage level higher than the other employer was offering.</p>
<p>As Posner points out, union leaders need to negotiate compensation that is higher than supply and demand would otherwise produce for the workers, in order to justify their existence.  To the extent they succeed, that compensation will be higher than those workersâ productivity.  In other words, to the extent they are successful, unions necessarily price themselves out of the market.  And in the auto industry they are doing so, as evidenced by the data cited by Posner.<br/>

<p>You would think with the wages being lower in non union shops, their cars would be cheaper but that isn't the case.  A subcompact GM car costs less than an Asian subcompact.  </p>

<p>You would think with the wages being lower in non union shops, their cars would be cheaper but that isn't the case.  A subcompact GM car costs less than an Asian subcompact.  </p>

<p>Enough with the ivory tower BS definition of what the "goals" of unions are. Unionization was a political and economic phenomenon and should always be analyzed as such.

<p>Stella:  Do you mean that Japanese cars cost more at the dealership, or that the cost to produce Japanese cars is higher.  Japanese cars cost more at the dealership because, on average, consumers want them more.   The question is how much the manufacturer is making (or losing) on each car they sell.   <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you mean that it costs Honda more to make a Civic than it costs GM to make its closest equivalent, then you may have a good point, but I think that Honda's costs per car are significantly lower.  </p>

<p>WD40: <br/>
<br/>
I haven't broken it down to economic jargon, but here is the story I would tell to explain featherbedding.<br/>
<br/>
1) It reduces risk.  The grievance procedure makes it difficult to fire employees, including unproductive employees.  I might prefer to get paid slightly more to be more productive, but I don't want to take the risk that I might turn out to be an unproductive employee down the road.</p>
<p>On a related note, in an industry with *expanding* demand for union-produced goods, increased per capita productivity could lead to increased per capita compensation with no reduction in existing employment levels.  In an industry with declining demand, an increase in per capita productivity would be likely to result in a decline in total employment.  Unless a given worker was confident that the job losses wouldn't affect him/her, that worker might prefer the current situation to the risk of losing a job.<br/>
<br/>
2) The job is sufficiently mind-numbing that employees really don't want to be more productive per hour, even if it would result in more income.  (See the Rand Simberg piece that Judge Posner links for a good description of this).<br/>
<br/>
3) Many of the featherbedding rules, like the job bank or the rules that prevent non-electicians from changing light bulbs, are designed to prevent management from "cheating" on the agreement by substituting foriegn or salaried labor for union labor.  <br/>
<br/>
4) As a cartel, the union needs to discourage "cheating" by its members.  (See OPEC for a good example of this).  Work rules that discourage undue productivity avoid a "race to the top" that would reduce total employment from current numbers.  By contrast, the more the union can *lower* per capita productivity, the more jobs open up, which allow union bosses to collect appropriate rents for allowing people into the jobs and increase total dues, at least in the short run.<br/>
<br/>
5) Finally, at some level, if Posner is right and the whole concept of a union that doesn't domninate its industry is self-defeating, then maybe the union voters are misinformed about the relative benefits to them of featherbedding versus additional salary.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the UAW is making a Huge mistake regarding public perception...The Democratic Party is in control in the White House, Senate and house and in position to implement far reaching pro union agendas.  The UAW by "killing" the Unionized Auto manufacturing business in America is likely to give Unionization a very bad name and hinder the very agenda they represent.  Why not figure out a Way to preserve the very jobs and production they are choking right now by working with the Big Three to Preserve the production aka jobs of all.  To kill the Golden Goose is never a profitable strategy.  Eating feathers is not very satisfying and why be the reason America turns against unionisim.</p>

<p>Reply to J. Mann:</p>
<p>(1) Risk reduction can be accomplished in other ways than stupid work rules. <br/>
(2) it is possible that workers prefer lower wages over more mind-numbing work. Certainly, professors do. But then "featherbedding" is the wrong term as both management (through lower wages that compensate for any reduced productivity) and workers (through improved work conditions that  compensate for lower wages) are better off. If unions are able to accomplish this, then unions make the industry more profitable, not less.<br/>
(3) If it is indeed true that inflexible work rules reduce management cheating, then again featherbedding is the wrong term as featherbedding  implies that unions are being unreasonable.<br/>
(4) Cartels want to extract  as much wealth as possible for their members (rather than maximizing the number of members). Union members would prefer higher wages over rules that bring little value to themselves (featherbedding) or more workers. When unions bring greater rewards through their bargaining power, they can charge higher union dues. So more membership is not the goal of the union, but rather higher wages for the existing members and higher salaries for the union bosses.  <br/>
(5) Economists have a hard time accepting the idea that workers and union leaders don't understand the tradeoffs regarding their own jobs.<br/>
In a nutshell: the burden of proof is on those who argue against optimal (efficient) contracts.</p>

<p>WD40:  Thanks, that's a good explanation of your point.<br/>
<br/>
Why is "featherbedding" a bad or inaccurate term?  Featherbeds are good for the people in them, presumably - they're just not good if you want the person in the featherbed to be productive.<br/>
<br/>
Posner's point, presumably, is that comparing $55/hr for GM labor to $45/hour for Honda labor because the GM worker cartel has also negotiated for itself an amount of leisure per hour that means a GM hour is not worth a Honda hour, even if purchased at the same cost.  <br/>
<br/>
If I use cartel tactics to negotiate a contract that literally grants workers the right to spend 30 minutes of each hour in a feather bed and 30 minutes at work, that may well be rational for the union, given workers' relative tastes for leisure and income.  However, as Posner states, it is going to come at the expense of consumers, workers who would prefer to work harder, and, if non-union competition is permitted, at the expense of the unionized company itself.<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry for not being clearer - I should take more time to write a shorter, more concise post, but I am lazy.  I appreciate you sticking with me.)<br/>
<br/>
As to my specific points: <br/>
<br/>
(1) I thought the second paragraph to my point 1 (about maximizing employment when the unionized share of the industry is contracting faster than the natural rate of worker attrition) was nice.  Did you like it?<br/>
<br/>
(2) As I said, Posner's argument doesn't require featherbedding to be irrational from the union's perspective.  He just argues that the total cost of featherbedding + wage increases comes at the expense of consumers, many of whom do not work in industries with the natural advantages to unions of large scale manufacturing, and and the expense of the unionized company overall when faced with nonunion competition.<br/>
<br/>
As to point (4), I am going to stand behind it and label it "agency costs."  The interests of the union membership are not exactly the same as the interests of its leadership.</p>

<p>Somebody above was accusing Posner of a rant here.  Not even close!  Pay attention, dude, THIS is a rant:</p>
<p>I'm surprised none of you pro-union types argue that without the potential of unionization all workers everywhere would be worse off since, given the enormous power disparity and prevailing "labor is a cost" attitude, without its threat hanging over them, all employers would revert (as far as the law allows) to Robber Baron exploitation models.</p>
<p>It's a whole lot more sensible than trying to claim "featherbedding" is a safety issue.  What?  And we're all supposed to believe in the Easter Bunny, too, eh?  It's pure and simple a maximize jobs, maximize membership issue, nothing else.  </p>
<p>And others are looking for internal rationality in collective bargaining agreements?  They are products of duress. There's nothing logical about them, except that failure to agree is a sure and quick death while agreeing to a bad term or three is only potentially fatal and even then looks like slow death.  If you were management, which would you chose?</p>
<p>Anywhere unions have a true monopoly, they will act like every other monopoly.... with the same ruinous effect.  Unions killed much of American trucking, railroads (until the recent dramatic increase in fuel costs), and will soon make public education, and public services untenable as well.  </p>
<p>Even as the scorpion is carried to safety over the flooded stream, he stings the frog.  Sure they both die, but it's in his nature.  Unions always need to get more.  Once to reasonable, there's no place to go except beyond reasonable.  Once there, the host dies.</p>
<p>Judge Posner is right here (as is Professor Becker), just limited in scope.     </p>

<p>Richard sez:</p>
<p>"Under those conditions, market forces will result in a worker being compensated in line with his or her productivity. An employer cannot consistently in the long run pay compensation that is either above or below a workerâs productivity."</p>
<p>........ or so goes the simplistic theory of those who didn't quite get through Econ 101..... but!  easily available stats confirm that the above is NOT the case and IS among the top reasons unions and  collective bargaining were developed.</p>
<p>Item #1.  WERE the above to be true, then over the last 20 years as productivity has more than doubled median wages too would have nearly doubled.  But! median wages are virtually the same as they were 20 years ago, and of course, it's that number that is playing a major role in holding back our economy.</p>
<p>Item #2.  Twenty-five years ago CEO "compensation"  was about 60 times the wages of working folk and even that was a higher ratio than in most other nations, but today the ratio has soared to 400 times worker pay.  What happened?  Have CEO's become more scarce?  Or the demand higher? Do the huge salaries indicate that they are paid in accordance with their "productivity?"  While the productivity of those they lead remains stagnant as indicated by flat median wages?  </p>

<p>Questions?<br/>
1. How many of these "overpaid and undermining" auto workers do you think have more than one vacation home in lucrative areas throughout the the world as compared to the CEO, board members,share holders, etc.?<br/>
2. How much of the wages earned by said auto workers go back into supporting the communities in which they live. Be it through,purchases of homes, daily needs,automobiles, etc. as opposed to those high dollar guys mentioned above?<br/>
3. Once the unionization is gone, how long do you think it will be before those workers at the "better" manufactoring plants see a reduction in their wages?<br/>
I guess the answers to these questions would give further explanation to your reference of "redistribution of wealth". Since I live in a city that has two car plants, I am very familiar as to where the workers live and where the executives live, as well as the circuits in which they travel. There doesn't seem to be much redistribution of the "wealth". Now I beleive that a lot of this is due to an underlying bias in our society today of how the "educated" and "uneducated" should be compensated,but this is obviously not the forum to debate this. As a former member of a union, I am well aware of the "shortcomings" of their leaderships. But I ask are they of more harm to this economy than say... Bernie Madoff?</p>

<p>Jack, I did get through Economics 101 (they called it Economics 10 at my college), and a few more courses.</p>
<p><i>median wages are virtually the same as they were 20 years ago</i></p>
<p>The studies that have produced those data overstate inflation, and therefore understate real growth.  For a discussion of that, and other distortions in the data, see http://www.minneapolisfed.org/publications_papers/pub_display.cfm?id=4049</p>
<p><i>Twenty-five years ago CEO "compensation" was about 60 times the wages of working folk and even that was a higher ratio than in most other nations, but today the ratio has soared to 400 times worker pay. What happened? Have CEO's become more scarce? Or the demand higher? Do the huge salaries indicate that they are paid in accordance with their "productivity?" While the productivity of those they lead remains stagnant as indicated by flat median wages?</i></p>
<p>Market forces do not automatically result in everyone's compensation matching with his or her productivity.  But they do push things in that direction.  My opinion is that some CEOs are worth their compensation, and others are not.  Those who are not usually get fired sooner or later.  They still collect large compensation, because that tends to be guaranteed in an employment contract they enter into when they take the job.  In part, their compensation is shielded from market forces because of the separation between ownership and management in publicly-held corporations.</p>
<p>That's an issue that perhaps ought to be dealt with, but it is, in economic terms, largely a separate issue from that of unions pricing themselves out of a labor market.  The effect on union jobs that I described in my earlier comment would apply, regardless of what is done or not done about CEO compensation.<br/>

<p>As I said earlier, unionization must be analyzed as a political phenomenon. Not only does unionization consolidate employee bargaining power, but in today's environment it helps pay for LOBBYING and CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. Gasp.</p>
<p>As long as this is how business is conducted in this country, de-unionizing makes as much sense as unilateral disarmament did back in the Cold War. Take away Big Labor and Big Business will have a political monopoly in setting the legislative and regulatory agenda. </p>
<p>We just saw what happens when radical deregulation of an industry (banking) occurs. How's your 401(k) working for ya?</p>

<p>Stella is correct that the Hondas and Toyotas are generally more expensive to purchase than their "Big Three" counterparts.  The reason Honda and Toyota can charge more is not part of some nefarious plot--it's because Detroit's products are inferior and therefore less valuable.  No one should bother wasting time arguing that some "objective" reviewer assesses the quality differently--if the value of the "Big Three" products was comparable, they'd quickly drive the Asian cars out of the market until the Asian cars were reduced in price to match.</p>
<p>The UAW represents the people with the largest share of responsibility for the perception of poor quality, and they've had decades to use their influence to assure the quality gap would close.  Their failure to do so is being punished appropriately by the consumers, and we owe them no sympathy and certainly not one dime of tax money.</p>

<p>It's not accurate to equate plant work rules in the auto industry with featherbedding although many do result in increased production costs. </p>
<p>In my experience (34 years in labor relations at GM), some plant level work rules embodied in locally negotiated agreements, grievance settlements and practices can accurately be characterized as featherbedding but not all are attributable to the UAW. Other work rules define simple fair treatment in the workplace. </p>
<p>Many of the less justifiable practices' origins came long before the UAW--from the industrial engineering theories of Frederick Taylor most of which have been discredited (e.g. piece rates and a proliferation of narrow job classifications) and superceded long ago by behavioral scientists like Elton Mayo and quality gurus like W. Edwards Deming. These practices are hard to change. They are embedded in the plant culture of managers and union representatives alike. GM and the UAW have been working together to change these practices and improve productivity for a long time. Some UAW-represented plants are more productive than comparable non-union transplants. Others are not. It is a huge mistake in my opinion, to make a blanket comdemnation collective bargaining because of work rule issues or because of generous health care and retirement benefits negotiated in good faith many years ago. Many work rules do need to be changed and national health care reform may be the best answer to the health care cost issue at GM, Ford and Chrysler.  </p>
<p>Many if not most of the work rules grew out of management abuses and unfair practices that preceded the union--nepotism and favoritism in pay and promotions, overtime, layoffs and recalls, disciplinary action and the like. There was good reason for the UAW's demand for "justice on the job." </p>
<p>Sometimes the "justice" was overdone in over-elaborated work rules, however, in plant level negotiations against a strike deadline at a key parts plant or at an assembly plant whose models were in short supply. The people at UAW headquarters can be fairly criticized for authorizing local strikes to pressing demands which should never have been granted. UAW president Leonard Woodcock and VP Irving Bluestone, along with GM managers who gave in too readily out of short-term sales considerations, allowed the local negotiations process to get out of control. This undermined the grievance arbitration procedure as grievances were saved up for local negotiations rather than being resolved on their merits in the grievance procedure. This impaired efficiency at many plants in the industry. </p>
<p>In recent weeks we have seen a lot of uninformed commentary blaming the UAW and GM management for problems that were many years in the making. Much of the bloviating reminds me of when our labor relations VP, George Morris, used to quote St. Thomas Aquinas "Seldom affirm. Never deny. Always distinguish." when one of his staff produced a broad brush, simplistic proposal to an issue that required additional facts and complex analysis and answers. Messrs. Becker and Posner would do well to consider Aquinas's maxim and avoid exaggerated generalizations beyond their expertise about collective bargaining and "adversarial" labor relations in the auto industry, based on gadfly comments from individuals who probably have never set foot in an auto plant. </p>

<div id="c098560">
<p>The Becker-Posner blog has presented a most accurate portrayal of the problems facing U.S. Auto firms. However, their analysis can be augmented with insights from the works of other Illustrious Hoover Fellows.</p>
<p>In particular the work of Douglas North in Institutions, Institutional Change and Economic Performance is most compelling for the problem we are seeking to explain. I do not necessarily seek to elaborate any of Northâs finer points concerning the limits of economic actors to rationally maximize. However, I do wish to suggest that the U.S. auto firms rationally maximize within a specific institutional context. U.S. auto firms like their foreign competitors will seek to minimize the marginal cost of producing automobiles. If U.S. firms wished to invest in the capital necessary to radically alter their product line to meet market demand for more fuel-efficient products the marginal cost of production would be of enormous magnitude, especially in the short term. However, over the long term these short-term losses could possibly be recouped by increased sales. The question then becomes; why have foreign firms been better able to calculate their inter-temporal utility functions?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the specific institutional context that U.S. automakers reside in. The United States, especially at the congressional level is much more penetrable by private pressures vis-Ã -vis other industrialized countries. As Hoover fellow Stephen Krasner noted in his work Defending the National Interest, congress has multiple points of entry for interested U.S. corporations. Moreover, congressional representation is regionally specific, thus regionally concentrated industries such as U.S. auto firms are better able to promote their interests compared to firms in foreign countries where political power is less fragmented.  </p>
<p>The counterfactual variable to be analyzed (see Hoover fellow James Fearonâs work on counterfactual variables) then becomes divergent marginal cost functions for U.S. auto firms vis-Ã -vis their foreign competitors. For U.S. firms the marginal cost of capital investment required for altering output to fit market demand is always going to be more costly than political investment. Put more simply, it is much cheaper for U.S. firms to subvert the market with tariffs, subsidies, and possibly soon a bailout, than it is to operate within the market. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the solution to the problem defined as such is going to be a very difficult change of the institutional structure in the United States. As Krasner has noted the state department is much better insulated from private pressures, and thus better able to make decisions regarding long term national welfare. A possible solution could be a law that precludes congress from political dealings involving firms that possess marginal cost functions similar to those of U.S. Auto firms. Such political dealings could be re-allocated to a new branch of the state department.<br/>
<br/>
However, it should be noted that the aforementioned marginal cost functions are not necessarily coterminous with firm size. While Microsoft generates enough revenue to be of similar size to a large U.S. automaker, the marginal cost of market subversion for Microsoft is much larger compared to that of simply retooling production to create products that better fit market demand. Thus the solution to market subversion is not always going to be further market subversion. For the most part free markets will lead to efficient outcomes; antitrust laws vastly oversimplify situations when they purport to only deal with firms over a certain size or in a certain dominant position with respect to market share. <br/>

The management of these companies was woefully inadequate in performing even fundamental tasks on nearly every front: human resources, finance, product design and marketing, R&amp;D and manufacturing. Not six months ago, GM was touting its plan to put $500M into a new plant to manufacture a small car that would get 45 MPG.

Not six months ago, GM was touting its plan to put $500M into a new plant to manufacture a small car that would get 45 MPG. What more could GM's management have done to prove that they were completely oblivious to the demands of the market and totally ignorant of the fact that they had insufficient capital even to keep their current operations underway?</p>

added the words "self anointed" or "self-appointed." He strikes me as a gadfly who, after some superficial research, portrays himself as an expert on whatever is the topic of the day.</p>

<p>I appreciate Alan Pies' comments above relying on the insights of Douglass North.  Culture matters more than many economists realize. North is right to point to its importance in economic development.  Such insights can be applicable to understanding problems in the automobile industry too. For example, many of the Honda, Toyota, and BMW plants are in the South. There is a big cultural difference between the South and the Midwest.  Southerners are typically more cooperative and deferential to legitimate authority.  The German and Japanese cultures that these car companies come from also may influence the attitudes of upper management of these companies.</p>
<p>The organizational culture of these firms that channel the energies of its individual members is also a factor that needs to be considered.  As Edgar Schein of MIT has pointed out, there are different levels of awareness of the structure of an organization.  The first is the level on which the casual observer can easily witness the organization's expectations of dress and comportment as well as how people are rewarded for their contributions.  The second involves the explicit knowledge that the members of the organization can articulate in terms of their goals and basic beliefs about their responsibilities within the company as a "creed" and its mission statements.  Most importantly, there is the third implicit level where the daily routines and interactions of members become habitual and fall into the fringe of their consciousness.  Here people may act in ways that they are not fully aware of that may be crucial to contributing to the success of the organization or may undermine its basic mission.  The implicit beliefs and habitual actions may be greatly at odds with the explicit beliefs of the employees, management, board of directors, and stockholders.  The main action in any group or for any individual is the implicit level where actions take place day to day, minute by minute without overt awareness. </p>
<p>The centrality of the implicit level in any web of relations in a social, political, or economic institution should make it clear why the government is intrinsically ineffective in regulating business or any social structure since government officials can never be fully aware of the complexity and subtlety of what is transpiring in each moment even if they are there on the scene, which they usually are not. Statistical analysis will never reveal the nuances of these patterns although such analysis might reveal that there is a problem in general.  Only the market can reveal the extent of the problem and offer incentives for firms to change from the ground up over time through trial and error and actors on the spot making gradual changes as they adjust to each other and their customers and suppliers.  There is no formula that could be imposed from on high that could make these changes effectively since they can only be made continuously and with precision.  </p>
<p>One last factor that demonstrates that government and unions can get in the way of necessary change is the focus they bring on issues of "social justice."  The fact of the matter is that some people work together better than do others.  Homogeneity can very well facilitate greater harmony in organizations.  Union efforts to ban nepotism and government efforts to ban discrimination can very well get the way of a more harmonious and cooperative work environment.  </p>

<p>Based on personal experience, I agree with Judge Posner that: "some union activity ... is extortionate: the union and the employer tacitly agree that as long as the employer gives the workers a wage increase slightly above the union dues, the union will leave the employer alone."</p>
<p>However, not only does the law give union members who are victimized by such employer-union conspiracies no opportunity for redress, but it is the law that makes such behavior possible in the first place.  This is because, under labor-relations law, union members have no standing to bring most kinds of work grievances against the employer on their own behalf.  </p>
<p>Rather, only the union can do so, much the way that a public prosecutor has discretion over whether or not to file charges against a criminal perpetrator and the victim has no say in this decision.  Thus, union leaders are able to bargain away an employee's rights in order to obtain something of benefit to the union or its leaders, leaving the employee with no recourse.  </p>
<p>Accordingly, what is needed is a change in the law to give the employees themselves standing to challenge unlawful employer actions.  Giving the employees' rights to the unions is tantamount to a theft of those rights, and opens the door to extortionate activity in which both the employer and the union conspire to deny employees their rights.  </p>
<p>As shown in Charles Dickens' novel HARD TIMES, where a union member was faced with exactly this issue, these kinds of conspiracies are often the result of a legal system that is designed to serve the interests of the politically powerful rather than justice.   This is why, first, employers and, now, unions have been given disproportionate power under the law, while the employee has always been ignored.  Too bad Judge Posner refuses to address this inherent (and fatal) flaw in the law.    </p>

<p>Chris &amp; John, You're quite right in mentioning cultural differences in developed Labor Law. As for the South, The "Slave and Cropper" mentality still lies just beneath the surface. Which goes far in explaining the "Right to work" structure inherent in Southern Labor Law.</p>
<p>As for other cultures, the "Dictatorship of the Prolitariat" prevails or the control by class structure known as the "Untouchables" prevails. </p>
<p>So how do we reconcile these different approaches to the control of Labor with our Democratic Ideals? Such was the reason behind the legitimization of Unionization and the use of Collective Bargaining by the Congress &amp; Federal Courts in the Twenties, Thirties and Forties. </p>
<p>Now why should I give up the power and control over "MY Workers" when it's in my interest to continue to hold them as slaves and croppers, prol's, and untouchables?  </p>

<p>Plant work rules clearly affect productivity in the auto industry. However, itâs not fair to put the blame for them entirely on the UAW because many of the most troublesome rules originated long before the industry was unionized out of the now largely discredited theories of Frederick Taylorâthe proliferation of narrow job classifications composed ofrepetitive assignments quickly learned by uneducated employees. These and other concepts did not originate with the UAW, but were incorporated into union agreements when the plants were unionized, BY AGREEMENT with management. These wage agreements and many other work rules have accumulated over 60 years and are very hard to change. </p>
<p>Since the 1980s the company and union have recognized the need for change and cooperated to change the plant rules and culture. That was why Saturn was formed in the early 1980s. NUMMI also was used as a model for change in GM plants. Plant managers and union leaders spent time together at NUMMI to see for themselves how the Toyota production system worked, and how the number of grievances were kept down close to zero through better communications and mutual respect between UAW representatives and NUMMI managers.</p>
<p>In contrast, the transplants were able to start with a clean slate in new plants, with no legacy pension and health insurance costs, and with policies which reflected new behavioral science concepts and policies advocated by W. Edwards Deming, e.g., very few job classifications (two production classifications: Team Member and Team Leader, and two skilled trades classifications: mechanical maintenance and electrical maintenance whereas, a typical big three plant had multiple production and skilled trades job classifications which resulted in many disputes, problems and inefficiencies.) The UAW and the auto companies have cooperated to eliminate many of these problems through âmodern operating agreementsâ which permit more efficient production and maintenance. A number of Big Three plants equal or exceed productivity in the Japanese transplants. </p>
<p>From my experience in GM, the UAW deserves criticism for letting the local negotiations process get out of control when Leonard Woodcock was President and Irving Bluestone VP of the GM department. This continued and worsened under Owen Bieber and Steve Yokich. Local unions, instead of making good faith efforts to settle grievances on their merits saved them up to be bargained wholesale under the gun of a local strike deadline. This put tremendous pressure on management to concede to extreme demands at key parts plants or assembly plants for models in short supply. This process spread from triennial contract negotiations to strike authorizations during the contract over allegedly unreasonable production standards or health and safety hazards. The UAW damaged plant efficiency in many GM plants by repeatedly sujecting them to the pressure of 5-day strike authorization notices signed by the Vice President of the GM Department of the International Union. And GM management failed to develop an effective and consistent policy to deal with this problem. Instead of insisting that grievances be dealt with in the regular grienvance and arbitration procedure on their merits, out of short-run sales and profits considerations, management succumbed to countless unreasonable grievance settlements and unwise agreements on local work rules. Unravelling the accumulated mess cannot be accomplished by the stroke of a pen by the national parties. A long and arduous process is required. </p>
<p>At the national negotiations level mistakes were made as well. In my estimation the worst was the infamous âJobs Bankâ agreement negotiated by Alfred S. Warren, with the approval of Roger Smith, with Owen Bieber. Instead of telling the UAW that it was impossible to guarantee lifetime income security in a collective bargaining agreement; that job security could be achieved only by making attractive products and selling them at affordable prices; and this was especially true in view of the unprecedented international competition facing the company. GM didnât tell the union that. Instead the company, at a time when the need to downsize was forseeable, made an agreement that greatly increased the cost of downsizing. This 1982? agreement should have gotten a Darwin award for the worst agreement in the history of collective bargaining.</p>

   In reply to your responses to two of my posts this week:  1.  I do not agree that having a cooperative attitude is equivalent to becoming a slave.  Friedrich Hayek makes a crucial distinction that might be relevant here.  He distinguishes between what he terms "true" and "false" individualism.  A false individualism that sees each person as a socially isolated atom leads to collectivism and social engineering.  In contrast, true individualism places the autonomous person within a social context with personal ties to his fellows.  The informal institutions that emerge around these personal relationships both facilitate cooperative, voluntary arrangements that serve everyone's interest while protecting people against external threats to individuals' liberty.  A similar distinction is made by Historian David Hackett Fischer in his discussion of 'liberty' and 'freedom.'  Fischer  notes that "the words themselves had differing origins: the Latinate 'liberty' implied separation and independence.  The root meaning of 'freedom' (akin to 'friend') connoted attachment: the rights of belonging in a community of freepeople."  We need a combination of both liberty and freedom assuming that we have the necessary self-discipline that makes people "fit for liberty" as Jefferson put it.  </p>
<p>In the present discussion, I am saying that the South has more of the true individualism as well as a better balance of freedom and liberty than the Northeast and Midwest.  One reason for this is our tradition, which developed over time from various sources.  Another is that the South has been more homogeneous ethnically and has set down more stable roots with less social and economic upheaval than other regions of the United States allowing a sense of place to emerge.  Unfortunately, those factors are changing, and so is the South.  I would say for the worse.  It could be a paradox that the factors that favor economic growth that I am alluding to in this discussion are being undermined by their very economic success.  Marx observed that capitalism tends to undercut traditional societies.  I am afraid that he is right.  Marx thought that loosening these bonds worked a beneficial side-effect to broaden people's social scope.  I see it as destructive and tragic. </p>
<p>2.  In your previous reply to my earlier comments, you said that you trusted Stiglitz and Gailbraith more that you trust me.  Besides being hurt by the comment that you do not trust me after we have exchanged comments for the past few weeks (wryly smiling here), I would suggest instead that we rely on evidence and logic as well as intuition to discover the truth rather than rely solely on the word of experts.  I see their comments quoted by another as reflecting a lack of understanding of the free market position.  They seem to be saying that free market advocates simply believe in turning people loose to do whatever they so choose with no consequences.  I am sorry to say that some "modal libertarians" and anarcho-capitalists do give such an impression.  But the classical view of liberalism and the free market seeks social, economic, and legal arrangements that hold people accountable for their actions and advocate the use of state power to prevent fraud.  So, I see the characterizations of free markets quoted above as misunderstandings or misrepresentations of the classically liberal position.  </p>
<p>As for the so-called "Fresh Water" and "Salt Water" schools of economic thought, these terms are simply catchy ways to refer to divisions among economic theorists that have been in place for some time.  I am very familiar with arguments for interventionism and undercomsumptionist macroeconomic theories.  I find them unsatisfactory for the following reasons.  The economy is far too complex and fluid to micro manage it.  These interventions must also necessarily interfere with the discretion of the individual as well spontaneous interactions among individuals so as to violate both liberty and freedom.  I find underconsumptionist theories mistaken since they overaggregate demand. They fail to realize that not all demand is sustainable over time.  They also underestimate the intricate balance between the various elements of the macro economy especially the necessary link between savings and investment.  This is also what Stiglitz and Gailbraith are missing in their evaluation of Invisible Hand approaches.  Think of the economy as well as society as a giant eco-system that is so complex and intricately woven together that no human mind can fully comprehend its workings on the fly. <br/>

<p>Unions are dying for the same reason the buggy whip industry died: supply and demand. Organized labor served a purpose back in the days when we were transitioning from an agricultural economy into an industrial economy. Back then there was a seemingly inexhaustible supply of workers seeking to escape the misery of the farm, and the oversupply produced wages and working conditions that weren't favorable to workers. Unions were devised to give workers some modicum of market power. But those days are long gone. I understand that it's difficult for some to get their heads around the concept of a general scarcity of labor since is such a recent phenomenon, but that's where we are today: we're out of workers. And this shortage has made unions superfluous. Why else would 95% of the private sector workforce eschew them?<br/>

<p>Chris, Ah yes... "liberty and freedomn" I prefer the distinction as, "Freedom is a state of mind, Liberty is a state of Reality." I've lived in the Northeast, Midwest, and the South. As for the South's conceived notion of it's superiority, most Texicans consider Dallas as the point where the North begins. The only difference I've seen is that the  street and river names change. As for the "Gentlemanly" behaivor, I take it you have never had to pull Picket Duty and talked to the opposition all night long and then called down a mortar barrage on their heads the next morning. As for "Classical Liberalism" and it's economic proponents, that died along with Locke, Berkely, Hume, Mill, Smith, et al. It's all a simple text book study now. And what is the invisible hand? Today that "hand" is much more visible than it was in the past. In fact, it might be more apropos too call it the "Alien Hand Syndrome".      </p>

<p>This is a rather perverse definition of a union "The goal of unions is to redistribute wealth from the owners and managers of firms". You might as easily say "The goal of stores is to redistribute wealth from customers to owners." It nicely loads the argument with the toxic "redistribution of wealth" bogeyman.<br/>
The goal of unions is to increase the negotiating power of labor by negotiating collectively. Similarly the goal of corporations is the increase the power of capital by centralizing it in the corporation. It's a balancing act. <br/>
Unions didn't cause the erosion of America's manufacturing base. If they did, then non-unionized industries wouldn't have seen the same flight of factories. </p>

<p>Yes, neilehat, there are different definitions and applications of liberty and freedom.  Most famously Issiah Berlin discussed two concepts of liberty in a famous essay.  David Hackett Fischer, though, touches on a commonly overlooked distinction and crucially important aspect of freedom, viz. the freedom to form social unions with compatible people.  Certainly, this notion of freedom has been completely lost on the ACLU.</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, the people one works and lives with have a tremendous effect on one's productivity, personal development, and personal happiness.  Study after study demonstrates these relationships.  We are not social atoms who are fungible.  One accurate criticism of classical liberalism made by conservatives and Marx is that liberals neglect the vital importance of a common life with those one lives around.  There are classical liberals who did not fall prey to this oversight such as Thomas Jefferson, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Benjamin Constant.  But the notion that people are like interchangeable parts of a machine is part and parcel of the mindset that developed out of the Newtonian scientific-capitalistic mass production economy paradigm.  I see this shortcoming as a legitimate target for attack by opponents of the market.  </p>
<p>Philosopher Jerry Fodor observes that linguistic differences will emerge over time even if a group is homogeneous as they begin a process of geographical separation, say, by an ocean or mountain range.  Not only does language evolve in different directions but so do all social conventions that facilitate human interaction.  It is a catastrophic mistake to think that these habits and customs will just adjust and all will be fine.  Most people are simply not that instantly flexible.  Again, we have the seed of an astute criticism of capitalism.  It is so flexible and adjusts so quickly that the human psyche and relationships cannot keep up.  Unions' penchant for slowing growth and change may be harmful for economic reasons, but might very well be beneficial socially and psychologically. </p>

<p>Welcome Sarah!  In reply to neilehat on attending union meetings, I would ask you to consider the analysis of Edgar Schein that I mentioned above on the different levels of awareness in an organizational culture.  Remember that the implicit level where people act day to day might very well differ from what workers and managers explicitly map out to accomplish.  The implicit trumps the explicit.  </p>

<p>Ford makes decent cars in Europe and GM makes damn good cars in Oz. So why are they making such rubbish in the US? Also does it not annoy you when people going on about âbuying Americanâ when it comes to cars (and they mean the big 3) no matter how bad they are?<a href="http://www.edhardyuk.co.uk" rel="nofollow">ed hardy</a>,<a href="http://www.abercrombieonsale.com/" rel="nofollow">abercrombie</a></p>

<p>Good afternoon. I lived what most people call the good life. I was happy, but deep inside I always felt that, with the short amount of time we are given to live and love in this world, we spend too much time loving things instead of people.<br/>
I am from Qatar and also now am reading in English, tell me right I wrote the following sentence: "Kitchen furniture can save space, create organization, and in many cases maintain sanity."</p>
