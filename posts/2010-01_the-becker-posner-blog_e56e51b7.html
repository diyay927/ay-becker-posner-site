<p class="MsoNormal">President Obama, in his State of the Union Address last
week, indicated that he would assist small business, particularly to encourage
their hiring of additional workers. Two days later he proposed a $33 billion
tax credit to small businesses that increase their hiring. I consider small and
medium size business the backbone of any dynamic economy, so I sympathize with
the President’s desire to encourage these businesses. However, his proposal is
not a good way to do this. </p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Obama’s aims are laudable: to
simultaneously increase employment, reduce unemployment, and encourage the
expansion of small and medium sized businesses. Yet, as an
employment-increasing plan, the President’s approach has many problems, and is
likely to have only limited impact. This is partly because while $33 billion is
a lot of money, it is less than ¼ of one percent of American GDP. Yet even a
much larger sum would have a small impact on employment. One reason is that the
subsidy proposal gives small business some incentive to fire some employees,
and then later to replace them with unemployed workers for whom they can
collect the subsidy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The unemployed hired under
the subsidy program would likely receive higher pay than they would get
otherwise because companies compete for these workers to qualify for the
subsidy. Some workers might then remain unemployed rather than accept jobs in
order to get the higher pay after the program is implemented. Employed workers
at small (and even large) businesses might quite their jobs and become
unemployed in order to become subsequently employed at other small companies in
order to become eligible for any higher wages received by new hires. The
President is aware that efforts will be made to game the proposal, and he
proposed various safeguards. However, new ways will be discovered to
get around the restrictions that would reduce the <strong>net</strong> job creating potential. Further efforts to close loopholes
would lead the government to become more and more involved in the employment
decisions of companies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Smaller businesses are an
important source of innovation and progress. Businesses like Microsoft,
Wal-Mart, Apple, Google, and many others introduced game-changing innovations
when they were very small that enabled them to grow very large, and they raised
overall productivity. This is why it is so important to promote startups and
other smaller businesses in an efficient and effective way. An effective
approach has several components, and overall the US looks quite good compared
to other countries. According to World Bank estimates, the US ranks 8<sup>th</sup>
out of the more than 180 countries they consider on their overall index of the
ease of starting a business, whereas, for example, Italy ranks 78<sup>th</sup>,
and China 89<sup>th</sup>. On the other hand, the US ranks only 25<sup>th</sup>
on the ease of getting construction permits, and 61<sup>st</sup> on taxes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The US is tied for first
place on the ease of employing workers. It is much easier for American small
and medium size business to reduce their employment during bad times than it is
for similar-sized companies in Europe, Latin America, or India. This helps
explain why employment fell, and unemployment rose, more sharply during this
recent recession in the US than in say Germany, Italy, and many other countries
that have much less flexible labor markets, even when other countries
experienced larger recession-induced falls in GDP.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Unfortunately, several
proposals in Congress, and others mentioned by the President, would make it
less attractive to start a business, or expand a smaller business. Although it
is especially unclear after the election of a Republican senator from
Massachusetts what any final health care bill will contain, some of the
proposals would require all companies, with few exceptions, to provide health
insurance for their employees. The fact that many small businesses do not now
give their employees health insurance indicates that such a requirement would
raise their costs, and reduce their employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Small and medium sized
business owners are sensitive to capital gains taxes, increased taxes on larger
incomes, and high rates of taxation on estates. Yet leading members
of Congress have advocated increases in capital gains taxes, adding an
additional tax on ”high” incomes, and a return to higher estate taxes. These
proposals would hurt all higher income persons, but might be particularly
discouraging to startups,and to the expansion of smaller businesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I believe that smaller
businesses can competes effectively against more sluggish larger and more
established businesses without getting special privileges, such as the
President’s additional proposal to subsidize bank loans to small businesses. However,
small business does thrive much better in an environment where success is not
taxed at high rates, and where regulations and mandates do not have a
disproportionately large effect on their costs and profits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
