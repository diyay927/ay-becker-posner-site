<p>Inequality in the US has grown substantially since 1980. As
a result, “poverty”, often defined as the fraction of families with incomes
less than half the average income, has increased greatly. Similarly, “near
poverty”, defined say as families with incomes between a half and three
quarters of average income, has also grown by a lot. It is no surprise that
greater income and wealth inequality has a big effect on the degree of poverty
since it is a property of all distributions that more variability especially
raises the fraction of observations at the tails of the distribution. In the
income and wealth case, this means particularly rapid increases in the
fractions of the poor and very wealthy as inequality increases.</p>
<p>The main causes of the growth in US earnings inequality are
in order of importance: the large increase in returns to education and other
skills, the rapid growth in households headed by unmarried mothers, the
financial crisis and the resulting large expansion of unemployment, especially
of lower income workers, and the big growth in some income maintenance programs
that have induced some workers to leave the labor force.</p>
<p>Previous discussions on our blog and elsewhere have
documented the rapid growth during past 40 years in the returns to college
education, and to a lesser extent to high school graduation. The large
expansion in the fraction of children living in households headed by a single
parent increased to about 28% due to the boom in divorce rates and in the tendency
of women to have children without being married. The recession that accompanied
the financial crisis raised unemployment rates of high school dropouts from 7%
in 2007 to more than 13% at its peak. This is still at a highly elevated rate.
Finally, the recession lowered eligibility requirements for food stamps,
Medicaid, mortgage reduction, and other welfare programs. This led to a decline
in labor force participation among lower income workers in order to increase
their prospects of qualifying for these benefits (see the evidence and
discussion in Casey Mulligan’s “The Redistribution Recession”).</p>
<p>Many separate approaches are available to attack each of
these causes of greater poverty rates, but improved education would significantly
reduce the incidence of each one. The crucial education improvement would be in
much lower dropout rates from high school and from four-year college programs. Lower
dropout rates starting soon would take years to affect a large fraction of
labor force, but the benefits would be enormous. First of all, the fraction of
persons with very low incomes would decline greatly since high school dropouts
and some high school graduates make up the bulk of the low-income population,
although a boost in the fraction of the labor force who graduated high school
and finished college would also lower the returns to education.</p>
<p>Educated persons have more stable marriages and are less
likely to have children out of wedlock or out of stable non-married relations.
This means that reducing high school and college dropouts would also reduce the
incidence of the family structures that lead to low household incomes. Greater
education may not reduce the incidence of serious recessions, but it would
reduce the vulnerability of the labor force to these recessions. Finally, a
more educated population would be less tempted to leave the labor force to take
advantage of food stamps and other welfare programs because they would then have
to give up too much in the way of earnings.</p>
<p>There is no magic way to improve the education of younger
persons, especially given the vicious cycle between less educated and
low-income parents, broken households, and low education and other poor
performance of children. However, as argued in more detail in earlier blogs (see
for example Sept. 2012 on “Good and Bad Teachers”), more charter schools and a
greater use of school vouchers, teacher evaluations based on objective measures
of their performance, much better pay for good teachers (such as teachers whose
students perform better), and weaker tenure for bad teachers would go a
considerable way toward reducing school dropouts and improving the overall
education performance of American students.</p>
