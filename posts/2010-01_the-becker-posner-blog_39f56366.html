<p class="MsoNormal">The current issue of the Economist recognizes that the
dramatic change in labor force participation of women is one of the most
important transformations in the economic and social worlds during the past
generation. I will discuss the main forces behind this change, and also
consider whether the United States needs additional public policies to
accommodate women at work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several crucial changes have contributed to transforming the
position of women. Perhaps the most fundamental during the past half century
were technological advances, such as the computer, and the shift in richer
countries away from manufacturing and toward services. These developments put
much greater emphasis on knowledge and information as opposed to physical
strength and heavy work, which in turn greatly increased the importance of
higher education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Women have shown a greater capacity than men in completing
universities and four-year colleges, largely because women have greater and
less variable non-cognitive skills, such as study habits. While the fraction of
men with four-year college degrees in the United States has stagnated since
1970, the fraction of women with these degrees has exploded, so that now women
receive almost 60% of the four-year degrees in the United States compared to
only 40% in 1970. Similar shifts in higher education toward women have taken
place in European countries. Related trends are occurring also in developing
countries, even in fundamentalist Iran.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The increased importance of skills and knowledge has greatly
affected parental fertility and investment decision. As parents have recognized
the importance of a good education and other training to succeed in the modern
world, they have opted for fewer children since giving extensive education to
many children would be too expensive. Therefore, modern parents have lower
birth rates than parents did in the past, and instead invest much more in each
child. This has produced sharply declining birth rates almost everywhere, and
below replacement fertility rates in about 90 countries that include all
European nations, much of Asia, including China, Japan, and South Korea, and
even a few mainly Moslem nations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The declines in fertility and shift toward greater
investment in children have been accelerated by the growing education of women,
who tend to be particularly concerned about providing a good education to their
children. This helps explain why educated women have relatively few children
and invest more in the schooling of each child. In addition, the time spent by
educated mothers in child rearing is more expensive since they can earn more in
the labor force. This too helps explain why women who graduate from college
have always tended to have fewer children than other women did.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These trends toward greater emphasis on knowledge and
information, low fertility, and much greater education of women, have all
contributed to the large growth in the labor force participation of women
during the past several decades. For example, about 80% of American women with
a college education are in the labor force compared to less than 50% for female
high school dropouts. Although women are more likely to work part time than
men, the gap in their labor force participation rates has greatly narrowed. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The recession affected men much harder than women since men
are more likely to work in construction and manufacturing, two sectors
especially hit hard. As a result, in recent months women have made
up about half the labor force in the United States. This fraction will fall as
the economy recovers, but the trend is still strongly toward gender equality in
labor force participation, and perhaps even toward a majority of participants
being women. This is partly because low skilled men have been withdrawing from
the labor force.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although women still lag by a lot in their representation in
the top managerial positions, they have greatly narrowed the gap between their
full time earnings and that of men. Wives earn more than their husbands in perhaps 30% of all American families
with two earners,  and that percentage
continues to grow. American women are starting new businesses at a much faster
rate than they did in the past, and the number of female heads of large
companies, although small in number, has been growing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although the United States has instituted various policies
to help working women, unlike Sweden and other Scandinavian countries it does
not provide extensive public subsidies to childcare, does not have a system of
legislated paid leaves to women that allow them to care for newborn children,
and does not guarantee that they can get their jobs back when they return to
work. Yet, contrary to many claims, I believe that the less interventionist
American approach may not have impeded, and may even have encouraged, women’s’
progress in the labor force.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite all the subsidies to childcare in Scandinavian
countries, the US still has higher fertility rates than Sweden, Norway, or
Denmark, and also than other European countries. Moreover, the labor force
participation rates of women in the US are not much below those in Scandinavian
countries, especially after considering that American birth rates are higher,
and that some women in Scandinavian countries are counted as having jobs even
when they are on paid child care leaves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Married women in the United States with at least a high
school education can “afford” to pay for childcare, and forego employment for
months or even years after having children, since they are usually married to
husbands who have decent to high earnings. Many of these women do leave work
for a while to care for their children, even when that means they reduce their
opportunities to advance when they return to work. I do not believe there is
much of a case for the government to pay these married women to take leaves
from work when they have children, or guarantee them their jobs when they
return to work. Government policies should be rather neutral about whether
women leave work to care for children or continue to work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, public policies to help children of
poorer women, including children of many unmarried women, may be justified since
these women tend to under invest in their children because they have limited
incomes and often low education levels. Childcare assistance and other subsidies
to investments in the young children of these women could well have a high social
return. The US does subsidize childcare programs for low-income families, and
could increase the subsidies to various head start programs. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But such interventions would not justify the Scandinavian
approach of generously subsidizing all women, including well off women, to take
paid leaves when they have children. Despite all their job guarantees after
they return to work from childcare leaves, private sector opportunities for
Scandinavian women, and women in several other European countries, are limited.
For example, about three-quarters of employed women in Sweden work for the
government compared to one-quarter of employed men, and women comprise a much
larger fraction of senior managers of American companies than of Swedish companies.</p>
