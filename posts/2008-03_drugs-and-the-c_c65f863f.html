<h3>Drugs and the Cost of Medicare -Becker</h3>
<p><br/>
Medicare is the federal system that covers hospitalization, physician care, drugs, and a limited amount of nursing home care for men and women over age 65. President Lyndon Johnson started it in 1965 in a modest financial way when the elderly were a small fraction of the adult population, and when drugs and surgeries to treat diseases of old age were far fewer and less complex. This program has grown in the 42 years since then into a major entitlement, with spending of almost $400 billion, which is more than 3 percent of American GDP. Of even greater concern is the projected growth in this program during the next several decades.</p>
<p>If past growth in Medicare is a reasonable guide to future growth, and assuming that real GDP grows at an annual rate of two and one half percent, Medicare spending as a share of GDP will double by 2020, and increase some 3-4 times by 2050 to 10 percent or more of GDP. Dollar spending on Medicare patients would increase to over a trillion dollars by 2020. Less than half of the projected increase would be due to the further aging of the population, while the majority is the result of the expected continuing growth in spending on hospitalizations, surgeries, and drugs for the elderly of given ages. </p>
<p>Much of the increased spending would occur even with the most efficient health delivery system since senior citizens along with younger adults put a high value on living longer in reasonably good health. The value placed on longer life and good health generally rises as incomes grow; indeed, economic analysis and past experience indicates that the willingness to pay for better health will increase in the future at least as rapidly as incomes do. </p>
<p>Still, there is no doubt that while the American health care delivery system has many strengths, including an encouragement to medical innovation, medical costs for the elderly could be significantly reduced with no reduction in quantity and quality if various inefficiencies in the system were corrected. Numerous proposals have been advanced to make the Medicare delivery system more efficient. Former Secretary of State and of the Treasury George Shultz, along with Professor John Shoven, in an important forthcoming book, Putting our House in Order, review several of these proposed reforms and advance their own thoughtful reforms for social security as well as Medicare and Medicaid. We discussed various reforms of American spending on medical care in our blog posts on January 13 of this year, and I will not repeat them now. </p>
<p>Instead, I discuss why drugs should have an important role in inefficient as well as efficient medical delivery systems. Medicare only started to cover spending on drugs in 2003, and the coverage had various defects. These include a deductible that is much too low, and a "doughnut" where there is no coverage at all for additional spending in the middle ranges of drug spending (see my discussion on Feb. 13, 2005 of these and other defects of drug coverage, with suggestions for how to make that coverage more effective). It is no surprise that spending on drugs by the elderly were not part of Medicare at the beginning since drugs were a minor part of their total medical spending in 1965. However, discoveries since then have led to various blockbuster drugs, and many less revolutionary advances in medications. These include drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, to treat Parkinson's disease and other disorders of the nervous system, to help thin the blood, to overcome erectile dysfunction, to fight Aids, and to reduce testosterone to combat the spread of prostate cancer. The share of their total medical care that seniors spend on drugs has moved steadily upwards during the past 40 years, and now is more than 12 percent, and before long might approach 20 percent. </p>
<p>Drugs should be part of an effective health delivery system not only because of the continual introduction of new drugs, including a growing importance of genetic based drugs, but also because drugs have a very attractive cost structure, especially for the growing elderly population. As the number of persons over age 65 increases during the next several decades, it would be useful to have a health delivery system in which costs do not rise as rapidly as the number of persons treated. Surgeries do not have this property since their cost tends to increase in proportion to the number of surgeries performed since each one takes a more or less fixed number of surgeons and supporting personnel. Hospitals also have few economies of scale with respect to the number of in-patients treated once a relatively small efficient bed size is reached.</p>
<p>Drugs have a totally different cost structure. They typically have very high fixed costs of research and development and low marginal costs of adding additional users. To develop a new drug to treat depression, or Alzheimer's, or another serious medical problem, usually requires hundreds of millions of dollars in the form of spending on research and various stages of clinical trial development, including many failures before a successful treatment is developed. Once a valuable drug is developed, however, the cost of producing each pill is usually small, certainly a tiny fraction of its fixed costs of development. This means that additional users can be added with relatively little increase in total costs, and a decline in average cost per user.</p>
<p>This property of the cost of producing drugs has two extremely important implications for Medicare costs. The first is that drugs are an efficient way to treat diseases and disorders that hit a large number of men and women since then the fixed costs can be spread over a larger number of users. This makes them particularly valuable to the elderly who are a growing share of the population in the United States and all other developed countries, and in many developing countries as well, including China. Moreover, the U.S. and world populations are also increasing, which increases the demand for all drugs, including those that help treat older persons.</p>
<p>Drugs are also valuable in inefficient delivery systems that have trouble choking off medical treatments that would not pass a benefit-cost calculation. This would characterize systems with highly subsidized medical care, with excessively low deductibles, or with rules that cannot deny treatments to the very elderly and those close to dying who would benefit only a little from receiving treatment. Surgery, hospitalization, and close physician supervision are expensive ways to treat seniors who do not benefit much from this care since the cost of these procedures tend to rise in proportion to the number treated. On the other hand, while treating seniors with drugs sometimes also may not add much in the way of benefits, the additional cost per user would be much smaller than the average cost per user. This property of the cost of using drugs makes them particularly useful in the American medical system since that system errs on the side of generosity toward the elderly and others compared to the health care systems in most developed countries. </p>
<p>This advantage of drugs in inefficient health delivery systems does not argue against the need for major reforms of Medicare to make it more efficient. It recognizes, however, the value of second-best solutions in a political environment where reforms of health care are likely to come slowly because they run up against many powerful vested interests. <br/>

<p>"almost $400 billion, which is more than 3 percent of American GDP."</p>
<p>......... it does not bother me in the least that a society might spend 3 percent of its GDP on the medical care of its elderly citizens.  While the projected growth might be troubling, it's only with tongue partly in cheek that I'd parrot the "starve the beast" concept of EARLY Reaganism, however instead of starving domestic programs as were their, stated, intent, perhaps it would starve our ability to engage in costly wars with little forethought.  </p>
<p>But IS the projected cost a huge problem? Let's take a look:</p>
<p>"Medicare spending as a share of GDP will double by 2020, and increase some 3-4 times by 2050 to 10 percent or more of GDP. Dollar spending on Medicare patients would increase to over a trillion dollars by 2020. Less than half of the projected increase would be due to the further aging of the population, while the majority is the result of the expected continuing growth in spending on hospitalizations, surgeries, and drugs for the elderly of given ages."</p>
<p>.......... The "10% of GDP" would mean that we'd be devoting a much higher percentage of our resources to the medical care of those over 65.  Looking closer, the dramatic rise in those costs are largely wages paid in the US, devices largely designed and mfg here, and drugs as Becker mentions have high first cost (more wages) and later low per unit costs.  </p>
<p>Given higher than average wages in the health sector, of the trillion Becker projects perhaps $250 billion would be directly returned to the Treasury from taxes.  </p>
<p>Then, contrary to Becker, it's my belief that efficiencies will take place as these costs continue to rise.  If they don't? given the number of jobs related to Medicare then it's likely that efficiencies will be made somewhere else in our economy.  We all know that a large percentage of our existing economy is comprised of utterly unnecessary make-work.</p>
<p>Looking back of over the econ history of the last century, we used a large percentage of "GDP" just to provide food for our table, then we spent heavily on two World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam, and more recently a hefty share of GDP was that of building new housing stock, along with the infrastructure of a federal highway system, lots of federal buildings and prisons.  In the next quarter century we'll devote a high percentage of GDP to various types of elder care and make dramatic improvements in productivity in the rest of the economy to make up for it.  My guess is that integrating Mexico into the NA economy will play a large role too. </p>
<p>Want some savings goals for this century?  The US with 3,500 nukes to the UK's 150, and Russia's couple of thousand should LEAD the way to a build down to zero and work closely with UN, NATO, SEATO, and all others to ban nukes and make the factors of producing or delivering them contraband. Today we've the means to know who is cheating and can deal with them by simply taking out the illegal facilities.  Once there is a treaty banning them for all, enforcement would be expected.</p>
<p>Are others here sick of those posturing in favor of frugality but willing to spend trillions on warmongery and spending more, even in peace time, on the military than all other nations combined? </p>

<p>Saint Darwin asks some combination of "why care" and "why should I pay".  We are probably all a little spoiled about this in developing countries, but we all have an interest in things like immunizations, diseases not being spread, etc.  Though I may never call the police, I like that they are there and will reluctantly pay my taxes.  Similarly, I like that my neighbors and co-workers likely can't give me more than a cold, so I do have an interest in them being healthy.  Further, the technology developed in the creation of treating Erectile Disease could one day develop into a cure for cancer or something, so cost/benefit is hard to tally.</p>

<p>Yes, medical practice has changed drastically in the last fifty years and Medicare is trying as best it can to keep up. There is one issue in this new development that bears close scrutiny, that of prescription drug coverage. If one crunches the numbers, I believe you'll find that it is actually costs less in the long run to treat chronic and other conditions through the use of prescription drugs than waiting until the conditions become so bad that radical medical intervention is required. What's the going rate for a quadruple bypass surgery and rehabilitation going for these days? </p>
<p>As for those who don't like even this development in medical care, perhaps we can go back to using the "Delta pill" when medical conditions become bad enough. Remember they only cost twenty-five cents a dose and you need to only use it once to achieve a 100 percent "cure" rate. </p>

<p>But most of the costs are due to non-generic drugs.  Monopolistic pricing decisions play a large part in both the costs of Medicare.  This is a kind of essential problem that needs to be solved, and I don't see a solution here.</p>

<p>Becker does a good job of summing up the situation this week but offered few reforms other than mentioning the Jan blog.</p>
<p>He sez:  (among much else)</p>
<p>Even if the uninsured did use emergency room care a lot and thereby raised the costs of others, a better way to handle that would be to mandate that everyone purchase basic health insurance that covers catastrophic health problems.</p>
<p>....... he joins Barack and Clinton in shooing us all into "insurance pools".  But once we're all mandated to jump into the pool and they,  mandated to take us, it seems they bring even less to the party than they do today.  </p>
<p>One thing that typically happens when insurance has a threshold such as a "500 deductible", "catastrophic" and/or "above $15,000" the number of such claims increase  and what might have been a $7500 event to be paid out of pocket, mysteriously doubles and the paperwork and haggling costs rise as well.  At minimum there is no cost containment effect on the "catastrophic" program.  </p>
<p>But is there on the paying out of pocket and shopping for a "good deal?" I don't believe there is as the individual is hardly equipped emotionally to price shop either his own health care or that of his loved ones.  He's also not equipped from a technical aspect. Sure, perhaps he could find "a good family doc" with a reasonable charge per visit, but what happens when he advises seeing a specialist, or going down the hall to take various tests?  Decline? Go shopping?</p>
<p>No, I think we'd have a far better chance of ALL having decent health care in a Mayo Clinic or Kaiser type of health care PROVIDER institution in which the costs of paperwork, squabbling, and yes insurance co CEO gleanings are applied directly to health care in a system not too unlike the VA which strives to lower costs by doing more preventative care.</p>
<p>Perhaps if we are lucky, or wise enough, to pass on electing the "stay the fatal course" candidate, that one of the two forward looking candidates, once in office will develop the spine or "discover" that we simply don't have enough wealth to continue to afford insurance company overhead and build a healthcare system in which insurance companies buy some health care facilities and provide a service or go find something else to do with their assets.</p>

<p>Is there a cost benefit analysis done on what drugs are covered in health plans? My health plan just payed $500 for a foam to treat psoriasis. If I had to pay for it myself I wouldn't have bought it, not because I can't afford it but simply because it is not worth it. Why? I also take another drug which only costs $15, this second drug gets rid of 99% of my psoriasis, the $500 foam is for the other 1%.</p>

<p>If one thinks back to the early 1960s, one will recall that the primary argument against medicare was that it would break the bank. Guess what.</p>
<p>Below is a letter I sent in response to Professor Fuchs and Dr. Emmanuel relative to their recent commentary on health care costs. It is relevant here.</p>
<p>Even though both Professor Fuchs and Dr. Emmanuel make their livings from the medical-industrial complex, it is clear that their understanding of the current state of healthcare affairs is incomplete.<br/>
<br/>
Right or wrong, the 17% of GDP spent on healthcare in the United States is one of the few steady engines of employment. Where would the good gentlemen propose that those dollars and hence the jobs go? To manufacturing? I don't think so. The United States is now a bubble economy and when one bubble bursts (dot com, real estate), there had better be another on ready to take over (health care, energy). At least the healthcare "bubble" is somewhat protected from asset hyperinflation.<br/>
<br/>
Of course healthcare is expensive. Patients demand instant and high tech services and to live long, happy and healthy lives. Fuchs and Emmanuel question the value of healthcare but would admit that they want high quality healthcare for everyone. They hopefully would also admit that the life span is increasing and that 70 years of age is the new 55. I don't think that you can have it both ways.<br/>
<br/>
It does not matter what pathways the money takes to pay for healthcare. If it all was funneled through the federal government, the cost would be the same or more given the amount of waste documented in that sector.<br/>
<br/>
So the real issue comes down to cost. How to reduce the cost? Reduce use. Ration. Pay the providers less. Ration. Why would anyone go to four years of college, four years of medical school, three to five years of training,come out with $250,000.00 in debt, work sixty hours per week take call at night and on weekends with the threat of malpractice for the royal salary of $150,000.00 per year  Pay for performance you say? By the way, physicians usually do not perform their own tests and therefore do not profit from them unless they are doing so illegally. Hospitals are not paid on a fee for service basis but rather on some derivative of the medicare formula.<br/>
<br/>
The electronic medical record has not taken off generally because of cost, lack of physician acceptance, the necessity of work process re-design, lack of expertise and time expense. To compensate for those difficulties, huge amounts of money will have to be invested by the government or insurance companies. This is not likely to reduce costs at least in the short run.<br/>
<br/>
If the good professors want to immediately reduce the cost of care by 30%, reform the medical tort system so that physicians and hospitals do not feel the need to practice defensively. Until that is done there will continue to be billions of dollars spent on unnecessary tests and procedures, unless, of course, Professor Fuchs and Dr. Emmanuel wish to certify in writing that the tests and procedures are unnecessary.<br/>
<br/>

<p>Jim, well you listed quite a number of the things that comprise our current system which you indicate will "break the bank". Most of it seems fairly accurate except for the aging canard of "saving 30% via tort reform, but then you knock down most of the other reforms as if the status quo would always be the status quo despite "breaking the bank"</p>
<p>A couple of questions:</p>
<p>Why would anyone go to four years of college, four years of medical school, three to five years of training,come out with $250,000.00 in debt, work sixty hours per week take call at night and on weekends with the threat of malpractice for the royal salary of $150,000.00 per year?</p>
<p>...........Hmmm, because they didn't favor going to college and having debt only to start at $30k as a teacher?  But more seriously, why is it that they work 60 hours per week...... IF such is the case?  Too few docs even with those from India and other nations coming in?  Any ideas?  Like opening  up more slots for medical students before the ONLY way to find care is that of traveling to India?</p>

<p>Jack, They're just beginning to understand why medical costs are so cheap overseas. They have "discovered" that these "medical practioners" have been "farming" organs, blood, etc. from the poor and destitute (for a less than nominal fee, "organ slaves") for years. And I won't even mention the practice of "liscensing". What ever happend to WHO? It may go far in explaining the mysterious rise in communcable disease's and HIV (not too mention the rise of drug resistant strains) in populations once far removed geograpically from the point of origin.    </p>

<p>Jack,</p>
<p>Thank you for your thoughtful comments.</p>
<p>I don't know if the tort factor is exactky 30% but I do know from personal experience and study of specific issues in that regard that it is a significant number. Having looked at non-infused CT scans of the head on ER patients with no physical findings but with one or more of seventeen symptoms, and using current payment rates, I found that it costs $12,000 to find one positive case and that does not consider even whether or not intervention would be necessary in those cases. the incidence of positivity was 4-5% except for amnesia and/or intoxication in which case it was 9-11%. When I presented these findings to several prominent trial attorneys to ask if these numbers would justify not doing the CT scans in certain cases, the answer was "As long as you can convince the jury that what you did was reasonable." You can guess what the ER physicians said.</p>
<p>A teacher making $30,000 per year pays no taxes and probably receives an earned income credit and works nine months per year. I am speaking of persons who are interested in medicine but who look at primary care and say, "not worth it." In addition, many primary care physicians are females who work part time in their child bearing years and therefore contribute to the shortage. If one puts through more MD candidates, most will be attracted toward the higher paying specialties. Check out the Maryland Hospital Associations commissioned study on the physician supply in Maryland. I suppose going to India for you health care is an option, better than no health care at all, or maybe not.</p>
<p>"Breaking the bank" is referring to the cost and fiscal integrity of the Medicare program. As an aside, many poorer medicare patiens do not opt for Part B which pays physicians because it costs part of their social security income. That doesn't help with the problem of access and prevention.</p>
<p>And oh yes, the status quo will be very difficult to change but in the meantime, Medicare insolvency could treaten the entire system.</p>

<p>Neil  I'm hoping your comments do not indicate that you think the medical systems of other nations are necessarily inferior to our own.  I've not been to India but have friends from their and my guess is that in that poverty wracked nation there is first world medicine for those with money and much lower standards for those who don't.  Have you noticed companies encouraging their employees to be "medical tourists" so as to save money?  </p>

<p>......... please keep in mind that our tort system also works to maintain standards and save the costs that would be spent were malpractice even more common than it is.

When I presented these findings to several prominent trial attorneys to ask if these numbers would justify not doing the CT scans in certain cases, the answer was "As long as you can convince the jury that what you did was reasonable." You can guess what the ER physicians said.</p>
<p>........... Hmmm, It strikes me as "interesting" how the numbers compare to real estate commissions where it is said that a good realtor will close a deal after dealing with about 20 clients.  To the one that closes it seems like a lot for not much work, but they weren't there when the guy was hauling around the other 19.  But I stray, perhaps; suppose, knowing the 5% odds what would you do or prescribe for a family member?</p>
<p>BTW every once in a while I get a glimpse of what the investment in a CT or other medical machine costs and what it returns by comparison to similar  investments in other sectors and am sure that CT scan costs should be much lower than they are.

<p>I don't know if the tort factor is exactky 30%</p>
<p>......... please keep in mind that our tort system also works to maintain standards and save the costs that would be spent were malpractice even more common than it is.  Sadly, our nation seems to have become one where we sprinkle ice-melt on a walkway out of concern for being sued, instead of out of concern for passers by and invitees breaking a leg, hip or back.</p>

My guess it that it will 'fix itself' by our adjusting to spending more in that sector, hopefully less on the warmongering sector, forced efficiencies in both medical care and the rest of our bloated and inefficient economy, folks working  longer (to an older age) and being "covered" by whatever a forward looking Admin and Congress designs before the whole mess goes broke.</p>

<p>Jack, What you've come up against is the classic economic public policy paradox, "the guns or butter problem". We could print more money, but then that's inflationary and in the end makes everything cost more. Although with cheaper dollars. National Secruity or Healthcare, hmm - tough choice. </p>
<p>As for medical capabilities, I trust the licensed medical professionals of the AMA more than I do the medical practitioners out of "Delhi Poly-technic" or the graduates of the "Moombasa School of Witchdoctoring".  </p>

<p>Jack,</p>
<p>What I would do for myself or for a loved one in the ER with symptoms or a history of trauma but with no physical findings would be to watch their neurological status with some cautionary explanations, probably at home. In most ERs that cannot be done because the physician and the patient are strangers to each other and therefore that approach cannot be trusted. It is interesting to note that the same patient with the same history and/or symptoms seen in a physician's office would be sent home with the cautionary instructions and perhaps referred for a CT at a later time, not being held to the same standard as the ER scenario.</p>
<p>By the way, the typical breakeven for a CT scanner in a hospital is two years, right or wrong, assuming the pro forma is reasonably accurate.</p>
<p>Physician assistants and nurse practioners are taking up some of the burden of initial visits but my own encounters with them have not been very useful. No doubt there will be more of that though.</p>
