<p class="MsoNormal">Both Europe’s short-term and long-term economic futures do
not look bright. The need to bail out Greece, and possibly also Spain,
Portugal, and Italy is the immediate problem, but the fundamental problems go
much deeper. Relatively rapid economic growth will cure many budgetary
imbalances since the challenge is not the size of government debt per se, but
its size relative to GDP. A faster growing economy can tolerate sizable growth
in government spending as long as the growth rate of its debt is no faster than
the rate of growth of GDP.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, large government spending and rigid
economies, the European approach, tend to both increase the growth rate of
government debt, and at the same time lower the growth rate of GDP. As a
result, the prospects for rapid growth in most European economies, and for
getting government debt under control, are dim unless major reforms are
introduced into their welfare state, labor markets, regulatory framework, and
other government policies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;">Europe needs high income and
other tax rates in order to finance its system of early retirements and
generous pension benefits, especially among its large numbers of government
employees, its liberal unemployment benefits, easy access to welfare payments
to support unmarried mothers, the care of children, and many other government
subsidies. Edward Prescott has shown (see e.g., his “Why do Americans Work so
Much More than Europeans”, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Quarterly
Review, 28, July 2004) that higher marginal tax rates account for a significant
part of the difference in employment, earnings, and hours worked between the US
and the main European countries. High tax rates reduce both the level of income
at any moment and the rate of growth of income over time.<span style="font-family: Helvetica;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Very low European birth rates contribute to the difficulty
in financing generous support of the elderly since fewer men and women of prime
working ages are available to be taxed to support the growing number of retirees, although
the greater education, and hence greater productivity, of each young European
partly but not fully compensates for having fewer young workers. The
substantial increase in life expectancy is an enormous benefit of modern
medicine and of greater knowledge about healthy personal care. However, longer
expected lifetimes have greatly raised pension and health burdens in most
European countries since their retirement ages have not increased in proportion
to the growth in years lived of older persons.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rigidities imposed by a single currency, the euro, will
continue to cause frictions and difficulties for countries in the European
Monetary Union. Part of the problem, as in the current Greek crisis, is the
separate fiscal regimes of member countries.<span>  </span>But budgetary deficits and reckless borrowing are not the
only forces that create tensions within a common currency. Some countries using
the Euro will at times experience severe shocks to their economy that create
unemployment and deficits in their foreign trade accounts. Economically weaker
countries with own currencies usually respond to such shocks by devaluating
their currency, as Greece frequently did in the past when it had the drachma. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Devaluation is not available to individual countries within
the euro monetary union. They have to adjust to bad shocks to their individual
economies either through increased unemployment, reduced wages, or migration of
some unemployed workers to countries that are doing better. These adjustments
are difficult for Greece, Italy, Spain and other weak members of the EU because
their labor markets are inflexible, and because many workers in these countries
are reluctant to migrate elsewhere, partly because they would give up generous
benefits. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">States of the US also have a common currency, and also face
state-specific shocks since they specialize somewhat in different commodities
and services. However, the difficulties states face in adjusting to their
economic shocks are reduced by the much greater flexibility of US than European
labor markets, and the willingness of many unemployed Americans to move to
states that are doing well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Apropos of comparisons between US and Europe, the US faces
many of the same problems as Europe, but generally they are in a more muted
form. The US has more flexible labor markets, lower marginal tax rates, fewer
invasive regulations, a smaller welfare state, higher birth rates, greater
immigration, more rapid incorporation of immigrants into the general economy,
greater encouragement to starting new businesses, greater competition, and many
other economic advantages. Nevertheless, the US has large fiscal deficits, and
large health care and retirement obligations that will be growing rapidly over time. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To manage effectively a growing federal government debt, it
is essential that the growth in entitlements be reduced, in part by raising the
age of retirement and of access to Medicare. It is also crucial that government
policies encourage more rapid economic growth of the American economy.
Unfortunately, this is not true of many policies proposed or implemented during
the past 18 months. These include, among many others, higher income taxes on
corporations and on persons with bigger incomes, government regulation of pay,
especially the pay of executives, health care “reform” that will raise, not
lower, government spending on healthcare, special subsidies to various unproven
green technologies, so-called job creation bills that create few jobs per
dollar spent, and more aggressive anti-trust actions against successful companies,
such as Google. These and other policies will reduce US economic growth at a
time when faster growth is more necessary than ever.</p>
