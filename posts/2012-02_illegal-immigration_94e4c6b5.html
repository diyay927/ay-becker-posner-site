<p>I agree with Posner that illegal immigrants are generally productive  members of the labor force, and make relatively little use of  taxpayer-funded programs, such as Medicaid and other welfare programs.  On the other hand, they pay little in taxes since they are frequently  paid in cash and often do not pay either social security taxes or income  taxes. In effect, they largely receive as take home pay what they add  to the output of the country.</p>
<p>It is also abundantly clear that, despite the rhetoric in the  Republican campaign debates, the US will never try to ship 11 million  illegal immigrants back to Mexico or the other countries they came from.  Some form of de facto amnesty may be inevitable for the vast majority  of these immigrants. Still, I find it difficult to simply accept  wholesale violation of US immigration laws, especially since, as Posner  indicates, illegal immigration will pick up again as the American  economy continues to recover from the Great Recession. Further  immigration from Mexico is surely to be expected as long as typical  young Mexican workers can increase their earnings several fold by  migrating illegally to the United States.</p>
<p>Beyond amnesty, what can be done to discourage further illegal  immigration to America, and reduce the number of illegal immigrants who  are already here?  Perhaps extending the wall on the Mexican-US border  would help a lot, although I anticipate that would-be illegal immigrants  and their “mules” would create additional crossing points into the  United States where there is no wall.</p>
<p>A more promising approach is to tighten the enforcement of laws  against employers who hire illegal immigrants. That is much more  efficient than directly hunting down illegal immigrants since the number  of employers using illegal migrants is much less than the number of  illegal immigrants. Tightening laws against employing illegal immigrants  might be effective even without sending more illegal immigrants back to  Mexico since the cost of employing them would rise, and that would  reduce the earnings and jobs available to illegal immigrants. As a  result, fewer immigrants would want to come here illegally, and some of  those already here would decide to return voluntarily to the countries  they came from. However, employers of illegal immigrants have political  clout, and they complain to government officials when enforcement  efforts against these employers is stepped up- recently Chipotle Mexican  Grill voiced such complaints when they were caught employing many  illegal immigrants. This opposition to enforcing the law more diligently  against employers of illegal immigrants reduces the political  attractiveness of that approach.</p>
<p>Despite the many difficulties they face, some illegal immigrants have  done well: they have risen into good jobs, and they are very much  committed to staying in the United States. These (and other) illegal  immigrants would be willing to pay a lot to change their status to legal  residents. Why not accommodate them, and offer all illegal immigrants  the opportunity to buy their way into legal residence? A price would be  set, say for concreteness $50,000, such that illegal immigrants who pay  that price could change their status to that of legal residents.</p>
<p>Allowing illegal residents to buy their way into legal status would  reduce the opposition to these residents because of a belief that  illegal immigrants get a “free ride” into the various advantages offered  by the United States. Yet it could also be attractive to illegal  immigrants, especially those who have made commitments to the United  States, because it removes the risk that they would be deported, perhaps  after many years in America. It would also have the political  attraction of adding money to federal revenues that is especially  welcome in these days of large federal budget deficits.</p>
<p>To be sure, it could be hard for even successful illegal immigrants  to raise $50,000, or any other significant payment to become legal  residents. A way to handle such liquidity problems would be to require  only a partial payment up front-perhaps 20%, or $10,000 in my example-  and start a government loan program that would make the rest available  to be paid off over time. In many respects, immigration loans could be  modeled after student loans. Such a loan program would be especially  attractive to the  well established successful immigrants who have been  in this country for many years, but do not have much in the way of  liquid assets.</p>
<p>I have argued elsewhere (see my monograph ”The Challenge of  Immigration: A Radical Solution”, 2011) that the right to immigrate by  paying an “admission fee” should be available to all potential  immigrants, not just to those who immigrated illegally. However, even  without such a radical change in overall immigration policy, the right  to pay for legal residence could apply only to illegal immigrants. In  fact, it might be politically much easier to implement such a policy  only for illegal immigrants because of the considerable opposition to  these immigrants. Many in the US and in other countries with  considerable illegal immigration might support a system that requires  these immigrants to pay for the right to stay legally.</p>
