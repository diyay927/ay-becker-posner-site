<h3>Orphan Drugs, Intellectual Property, and Social Welfare--Posner</h3>
<p>A pair of excellent articles by Geeta Anand on the front page of the<em> Wall Street Journal </em>for November 15 and 16 discusses the little-known but very costly Orphan Drug Act of 1983. The Act is designed, mainly by providing expanded intellectual-property protection (there are also tax incentives and research subsidies, but they are considered less important), to encourage the creation of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, defined as diseases that afflict no more than 200,000 Americans at any given time. Partly because different cancers are classified as different diseases, an estimated 25 million Americans have a rare disease as defined by the Act.</p>
<p>A company that is first to obtain the Food and Drug Administration's approval to sell such a drug has the exclusive right to sell it for seven years. Although this is shorter than the term of a pharmaceutical patent (normally 20 years), establishing patent eligibility is a far more difficult and protracted undertaking and a patent once obtained is subject to court challenges that often succeed in invalidating it.</p>
<p>The expansion in intellectual-property rights brought about by the Orphan Drug Act makes the following economic sense: The incentive to create an intellectual work is a function of the size of the potential market for it. The reason is that, by definition, the principal costs of such a work are fixed costs, incurred before the first sale is made; in the case of orphan drugs, they are the cost of R &amp; D plus (what is often greater) the cost of clinical testing, and they greatly exceed the costs of actually producing the drug. The larger the market, the lower the fixed costs per sale, and so the less the seller has to charge in order to recover those costs. If fixed costs are 100 and variable cost (the cost of producing one unit of the product) is 1, then if there are 10 customers the producer must charge each at least 11 (100 divided by 10, plus 1) to break even, but if there are 100 customers he can break even at a price of 2 (100 divided by 100 plus 1). Hence the rarer a disease, and thus the smaller the potential market for a drug to treat it, the higher the price that the producer must charge in order to break even. His ability to charge that high price will depend on his ability to exclude competition; a producer allowed to duplicate the new drug could undercut the price charged by the original producer yet make a large profit because he would not have borne any R &amp; D costs. The higher the break-even price and therefore the greater the profit opportunity for a competitor, the likelier that competition will quickly erode the price and prevent the original producer from recovering his fixed costs. Giving the original producer more than the usual protection against competition that the law provides to creators of intellectual property is thus a method of increasing the incentive to create drugs that have only a small potential market because relatively few people suffer from the diseases that the drugs treat.</p>
<p>This is not just a theoretical point. The fixed costs of a new drug are indeed high, even if the industry-sponsored figure of $800 million is, as I believe, an exaggeration. This means, moreover, that even without a threat of competition, the incentive to develop a new drug that would have very few buyers would often be insufficient to induce that development. Suppose a drug cost $500 million to develop and had only 50 potential customers. Then each would have to pay (over his lifetime) $10 million (actually more, because of discounting to present value) to enable the producer to cover its fixed costs. Health insurers might be unwilling to pick up such a tab. </p>
<p>The success of the Orphan Drug Act in encouraging the creation of orphan drugs (more than 200 such drugs have been approved since the Act was passed, compared to only 10 in the preceding decade), which in 2003 had total worldwide sales estimated at roughly $28 billion, confirms the economic analysis and shows that intellectual-property protection can have important incentive effects. But has the Act produced a net gain in economic welfare? That is less certain. Of course many people have benefited from the drugs. But the costs per benefited person are frequently astronomical; that is implicit in the rationale for giving producers of such drugs increased protection against competition. The costs are especially high for those orphan drugs, apparently the majority, that alleviate symptoms or prolong life but do not cure the disease, so that the patient has to take them for the rest of his or her life. The<em> Wall Street Journal </em>articles give an example of a woman who suffers from Gaucher disease and spends (or rather her health insurer spends) $601,000 a year for the drug, Ceredase, and its administration. Because by definition the percentage of people who suffer from rare diseases is small, it is feasible for health insurance to cover such extraordinary expenses, provided the insurance pool is large. And Ceredase is at the high end of orphan drug expense.</p>
<p>Resources for medical research are finite. The Orphan Drug Act sucks large research expenditures into creating treatments for rare diseases. Without the Act, those resources would be channeled by the market into other investments that might produce a higher social return. The English economist Arnold Plant pointed out many years ago that if the law protects some monopolies, as by granting patents or equivalent intellectual-property protection, the profit opportunities that such protection creates (Ceredase generates an estimated 25 percent annual rate of return on investment for its producer, Genzyme Corp.), which are not generally available in the economy, may attract into the monopoly markets resources that would produce greater consumer welfare if invested in production in competitive markets. As a result of competition, the price of television sets is much less than the price that people would be willing to pay if the sale of television sets were monopolized; the difference is "consumer surplus" and is a measure of the net value that the industry creates. For all one knows, the consumer surplus that would be generated if the resources now devoted to developing orphan drugs were channeled into competitive markets would exceed the net benefits of those drugs, bearing in mind that there are few beneficiaries. The number of people who take orphan drugs is far fewer than the total number of people with rare diseases. Indeed, apparently only 200,000 Americans are taking such drugs. Assuming that most global expenditures on orphan drugs are for Americans (I'm just guessing--I do not have U.S. figures), this would be an average expenditure of $100,000 ($100,000 times 200,000 equals $20 billion). Few people would be willing, if only because few people would be able, to spend anywhere near this much on drugs.</p>
<p>As the economist Tomas Philipson points out, however, if people who do not suffer from rare diseases derive a benefit from orphan drugs--whether because they are altruistic or because they fear that they or members of their families might develop such a disease--then the total social surplus created by the Orphan Drug Act may exceed the consumer surplus. Yet if the R &amp; D expenditures induced by the Act were channeled instead into developing drugs for equally serious but much more common diseases, this might well be preferred by most people.</p>

<p>  Even granting the questionable success of the legislation, it is wrong, on principle, to have the government incentivize private entites.  This is so even if it means that the incentive would lead to the production of orphan drugs.  <br/>
  Note that a patent does not grant a right, it merely uses government power, i.e., the authority of the law courts, to secure a right acquired by a patent holder.  In this scenario, the government is reduced to being a dispassionate arbiter that protects rights against force or fraud.  This is the only type of government intervention that should exist in a free society.  <br/>
  The government incentive that has been created here exists because the potential market for these drugs is considered not great enough to make a profit.  However, the business decision not to produce such drugs because the market is too small is one that need not be "remedied" by government intervention.  Instead, a truly free market would allocate R&amp;D resources for those drugs that can make the largest possible profit, i.e., those with the biggest potential market.  As for orphan drugs, the appropriate free market response would be to allow drug manufacturers--who have earned the aforementioned large profits in the marketplace--to voluntarily consider whether to apply some of those profits to R&amp;D for these drugs (this would be similar to the way that large law firms have associates that work on 'pro bono' or reduced fee cases).  If so, then the problem is dealt with privately, and the unique goodwill that such a venture would produce is a further incentive for this response.  If not, then at least the most pressing medical problems that can be ameliorated/cured by drugs, i.e., those diseases that strike the largest segment of the population thereby creating the largest possible market, will offer a natural incentive for drug manufacturers.  Resultingly, the greatest number of individuals will then profit from the availability of these drugs.               </p>

<p>Although the ultimate question of whether there is a net social benefit to the Orphan Drug Act is murky, it's existence could prove useful to economists interested in optimizing patent term length.  In particular, if seven years of perfect exclusivity is enough to encourage a significant amount of new investment in _rare_ disease treatment, one wonders whether seventeen years is far too long.  Even the compromises struck by the Hatch-Waxman Act look excessively favorable to drug companies.</p>

<div id="c077391">
<p>Posner makes a very interesting point with respect for the potential to for resources committed to orphan drugs to be used for other more socially valuable investments -- for example, investments into drugs that treat more common diseases.</p>
<p>Of course, the analysis is tricky, and I am sure that Posner is aware that he has only barely scratched the surface.</p>
<p>The first thing that Posner's analysis assumes is that there is some sort of competition for limited resources -- that resources not invested in orphan drugs would be available for something else. This sounds right, but it needs some careful thought.</p>
<p>First, what other things would funds not invested in orphan drugs be invested in? If instead of orphan drugs, those funds were used to finance, say, pornography or luxury yaughts, then the new allocation from changing the law would make society worse off. Drugs, even those which merely alleviate symptoms and delay the inevitable, might provide extreme utility to the recipients. The utility provided by such drugs may very well exceed even the monopoly inflated prices - but the user may be unable to pay without insurance. Of course, one's utility from consuming a product is not limited by mere ability to pay - and one cannot plausible say that, say Bill Gates enjoys more utility from consuming a luxury yaught than someone suffering from a disease suffers gains from having horrible symptoms alleviated. That being said, I am not necessarily defending increased allocations for orphan drugs, only noting that this is an important question. It could be that funds, instead of being diverted from pornography or luxury yaughts, are instead being diverted from research and development in other drugs. This would be the strongest argument against orphan drugs, rather than the suggestion that the funds would be better invested in the market in general. In any case, the key question is this: what exactly will funds not invested in orphan drugs be invested in? Only with that question answered are we really able to begin to ponder the costs and benefits, many of which are not susceptible to reduction to mere monetary values.</p>
<p>Second. Instead of diverting resources from other drugs, developing markets for orphan drugs might result in network effects that benefit drug development generally. It seems quite likely that many researchers and other professionals will not devote the entirety of their professional career to researching only orphan drugs. Instead, it is likely that researchers will shift their focus as both their skill sets shift and promising developments in other areas induce them to enter different drug development markets. What Posner is suggesting is that the presence of orphan drugs will cause existing resources to shift to their development towards orphan drugs a little more than is justified by their merits. However, this point only looks at the situation statically. It could be that the increased revenue to the drug industry from orphan drug production allows the hiring of a bigger pool of researchers, incentivizes research universities to create more programs with people trained in drug research, and in the process leads to productive collaboration beneficial to both general drug development as well as orphan drug development.</p>
<p>Third. If one thought that orphan drugs were bad because they shifted resources from more promising drugs rather than increased the capacity of the R&amp;D system as a whole, wouldn't this argument apply even more forcibly to some drugs which go through normal channels, such as Viagra. From a utilitarian perspective, it does not seem that a drug like Viagra is nearly as useful as say, one treating cancer. If Posner is right about orphan drugs, doesn't this imply that perhaps the government should avoid providing protection to drugs like Viagra in the future since they result in a diversion of resources from more socially beneficial drugs, like those treating serious diseases? I suspect that there are network effects -- that drug research is not merely a zero sum game -- and development of drugs like Viagra may in fact be beneficial to the development of more important drugs. However, if network effects are negligible, it would be an argument not only against orphan drugs, but against Viagra as well. (I should note that it would not be necessarily a conclusive argument, since even without network effects, on net, it might incentivize greater investment in the drug industry, which we have reason to believe is more beneficial than investment in the luxury yaught industry, due to the large positive externalities which investors are unable to capture in the orphan drug industry.)</p>

<div id="c077401">
<p>As always, Posner has clearly presented an economic analysis with disastrous, provocative results, and expected us to swallow the poison pill. His analysis is lucid, illuminating, and cautious and there is little with which to disagree. And yet the rigorous analysis obfuscates his claim that <b>society as a collective is better off if its weakest members are left slowly to die.</b> This rankles as much does his claim two weeks ago that democracy is analytically separable from constitutionalism, and so the kinds of inequalities that disrupt rule of law (e.g., rigged elections) are not anti-democratic. Technically true, but trivially true, and to many unsavory if not unpalatable.</p>
<p>I take Posner's point that a dollar spent to earn two dollars is a waste when one has the costless opportunity to make three. But I have two responses. </p>
<p>First, passing legislation is not free. Rescinding the Orphan Drug Act to replace it with a more cost-effective alternative will ignite political strife. Some will oppose the change, others will support it, many others will glom on to the issue and submit self-serving proposals for revision. Think of the hell to be raised by trying to reallocate federal funding for breast cancer research. Womens groups would denounce it even though there is a virtual cure for breast cancer, even though what funding is allocated to breast cancer is best spent on prevention, even though other diseases -- even other kinds of cancer -- kill more Americans, receive less funding, and affect both men and women, young and old. To make a long story short, that extra dollar of profit may never be seen because the hidden costs of implementing the change in regulatory regime may consume it.</p>
<p>Second, as I hinted at earlier in this post, what we value as a society encompasses more than pure efficiency. We tend to care about the personal stories of disease-ridden kids; we tend as a nation not to care as much about the fortunes of insurance companies that must pay off  astronomical bills. We tend to care about helping the needy, at least in theory; we tend not to care about pure economic theory. In our two party system, one party runs on cutting taxes to the point of bankrupting the government; the other runs on exclusively and perniciously raising taxes on the class of citizens that sustaining nation's economic engine. That said, "letting people die," which is how such a Posnerian reform would be reported upon, would not pass muster with enough Americans to guarantee a politician's support. We have had politicians secure the Presidency by promising to enlarge the size of government and politicanswho secutre the Oval Office by pledging to shrink it to a shrub, but never have we had a President who spoke of making the government more efficient by harming the weakest members of our society. Not only would changing such an act be costly, but finding energized and long-lasting constituents for it, even among its beneficiaries, would be difficult it not impossible. <i>Social Security reform, anyone?</i></p>

<p>I am not familiar with the details of the Orphan Drug Act, but based upon the statement above, there is a huge opportunity for gaming the system. By manipulating the classification of disease, rare diseases can be created where there were none before. </p>
<p>If gaming is possible, I am sure drug company R&amp;D is already being spent on working this angle. Because I would in their shoes. <br/>

<p>Sylvain,<br/>
Contrary to your fiery rhetoric, it is a fact that Posner is saying society would be better off if the woman with Gaucher's disease --let's call her Person X -- did not benefit from the Act because the regime the Act creates drives down total social welfare.</p>
<p>Person X has Gaucher's disease.  She and the overwhelming majority of other users of the medicine cannot afford to pay $601,000 per year for the medicine.  Without the act, the medicine would not exist.</p>
<p>I doubt you know very much about Gaucher's disease, but Person X most likely does not have type-2, because type-2 usually kills by age 2.  In other words, Gaucher's disease is a life-threatening illness.  A swiftly killing one, too.</p>
<p>Type-1, which Person X likely has, is the most common -- and without treatment, the life expectancy of someone with type-1 is drastically lower than that of someone without Gaucher's disease.  It is also the case that the symptoms of the disease do in fact make one "weak," as Gaucher's disease essentially destroys your neurological system.</p>
<p>Without the act, Person X would have been left to die slowly, painfully, and sooner than an able-bodied person.  She would not have had enough money to commission research to create drugs to treat her illness, and her illness would have claimed her.  When someone is powerless to help themselves avoid a preventable death, that sounds like weakness to me.</p>
<p>It is necessarily the case that cutting off the Act strands people like Person X without treatment or cures for lethal illnesses, because the profit motive does not exist to spur R&amp;D for cures or treatments without the Act.  Not only is this <b>obvious</b> to anyone with common-sense, it is <i>suggested by Posner's post itself.</i></p>

<p>W,</p>
<p>Sylvain's fiery rhetoric is entirely justified in view of your mis-representation of Posner's position and the illogic of your argument.</p>
<p>Posner merely points out the trade-offs and does not come to a conclusion as to the overall benefit of the Act, so your claim that, "Posner is saying... the Act... drives down total social welfare," is wrong.</p>
<p>The question is whether overall net benefit is increased by the Act. Posner's fundamental point is that there are trade-offs in research; researching a cure to one disease may deprive funding to research in more common diseases; if this is true total welfare may be reduced by the Act.</p>
<p>Your argument is that people with Gaucher's disease suffer, and the Act is good because it relieves this suffering. This is quite simply a false argument, because it overlooks the point that for every one Gaucher's patient saved (or made comfortable) by the Act, 5 or 10 or 100 may (or may not) be deprived of relief from other equally serious but more common diseases.</p>
<p>An assessment of the Act's net benefit cannot possibly be made with examining what is foregone, so your argument that Gaucher's patients suffer is simply useless on its own.</p>

<p>Ben: <b>This is quite simply a false argument, because it overlooks the point that for every one Gaucher's patient saved (or made comfortable) by the Act, 5 or 10 or 100 may (or may not) be deprived of relief from other equally serious but more common diseases.</b></p>
<p>Nothing in my argument is false.  The difference between the persons with Gaucher's disease and the persons who may suffer from other diseases is that the persons with Gaucher's disease receive an actual benefit.  We have no idea what will happen to the relevant monies once revoking the Orphan Drug Act is proposed; chances are it will be consumed by the legislative brokering process, as I argue above. So: you have guaranteed losses and no guarantee of any offsetting benefits. That you ignore this renders your argument obfuscatory, much as is Posner's post. (I would also note that an "argument" cannot be false; it can be invalid or valid. One of its propositions could be false, however. If you're going to throw around logical terms, you might as well know what they mean, ben.)</p>
<p>Sylvain: <b>...nor is it whether it would be in the interest of society for these or others to 'die slowly', a claim you then amusingly and self-contradictorily undermine by arguing that Gaucher is in fact a 'swiftly killing' disease. </b></p>
<p>I actually do no such thing.  What I say is this: "Without the act, Person X would have been left to die slowly, painfully, and sooner than an able-bodied person."  The "swift killing" refers to the fact that someone with Gaucher's disease will die sooner than someone without it (e.g., by age 2); the fact that the death is slow refers to the rate of neurological destruction.  If you knew anything about Gaucher's disease, you would know that.</p>
<p>ben: <b>Posner's fundamental point is that there are trade-offs in research; researching a cure to one disease may deprive funding to research in more common diseases; if this is true total welfare may be reduced by the Act.</b></p>
<p>I fail to see how that is any different from this formulation:  "Posner is saying society would be better off if the woman with Gaucher's disease --let's call her Person X -- did not benefit from the Act because the regime the Act creates drives down total social welfare." I would also note that I was summarizing my earlier argument. You, quite cunningly, quote from the summary in my second post, yet somehow have managed to ignore the first and most definitive post -- which was the subject of the dispute between Sylvain and I. Your critique of my argument on this basis is the equivalent to claiming an opponent's argument is false because of a typo. It should be obvious to anyone with common-sense that I did not write a quick one-sentence paragraph at the head of my second post so as to brush aside everything I had said in the first. I was simply responding to Sylvain.</p>
<p>I'd like to thank you both for increasing the chance that Posner will address my concerns.</p>

<p>One question I have about this issue is whether the money being spent on these rare diseases would otherwise be put to equally worthwhile use on other diseases.  I would first like to point out that a common disease will always have funding allocated toward treatment and cure.  So, the existance of this orphan drug act does not stop research and funding for more common diseases such as aids etc.  These common diseases don't need legislation supporting them because companies have a direct profit incentive for finding treatment (which is explained in Posner's post).  </p>
<p><br/>
However, without the orphan drug act, most of these rare diseases would see no R&amp;D from private companies.  Thus, the people would not be receiving modern treatment.  Providing these incentives helps makes sure that these people do see treatment and in the meantime, patients of more common diseases are still receiving treatment.</p>
<p><br/>
In an industry in which most of the money is spent for the treatment of common diseases (whether this legislation exists or not), some spending on the rare diseases is nessecary and this would only be done with some legislation supporting it.  So if you are looking at what is  better overall, I think that a large positive difference in the quality of treatment for these rare diseases outweighs the small negative difference in the quality of treatment for common diseases that results.<br/>

<p>I would actually disagree here. We have no idea whether a small negative difference will result in the quality for common diseases. Chances are the funding will remain constant. The funding for the Orphan Drug Act will likely be reallocated toward pork -- I don't think there is any reasonable prospect it would have gone to common diseases at all, so there's no reason to count it as a potential loss. Thus, you have guaranteed losses and no guaranteed offsetting benefits (i.e., from the reallocation).<br/>

<p>I agree with this, except to the extent that certain diseases have lobbies behind them. It may be true that the disease doesn't need legislation or more funding than the market provides, but politics does not always work! Breast cancer, as I noted above, receives more funding than is efficient. As soon as you seek to revoke the ODA, the bickering for redistribution of its monies will begin.  </p>

<p>Classic red herring. The same circular argument could be used to justify any government program by anyone with a stake or an interest in it : "If we don't spend this on the Patriot Act, it will go to 'pork', not Homeland Security..."</p>
<p>(Tongue in cheek) I mean, if we hadn't spent $200 billion invading Iraq, who knows how many bridges to nowhere we would have built instead so having ourselves a war might not be such a bad deal, right ? Who cares about the actual costs and benefits of the adventure itself ? </p>
<p>Either the Act can stand up on its own or it cannot. Where the money could or should go otherwise is a separate political issue.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the answer to the central question in this debate is: "We have no idea what will happen to the relevant monies once revoking the Orphan Drug Act is proposed; chances are it will be consumed by the legislative brokering process"</p>
<p>Thanks W, glad we got that one sorted.</p>
<p>Here's another one: what is the Meaning of Life? 2 sentences or less. Go!</p>
<p><i>I fail to see how that is any different from this formulation: "Posner is saying society would be better off if the woman with Gaucher's disease --let's call her Person X -- did not benefit from the Act because the regime the Act creates drives down total social welfare." </i></p>
<p>Posner did not express a view on the sign (positive or negative) of net benefits from the Act. Posner did not say society would be better off without the Act.</p>

To summarize : you've never claimed what you actually wrote, and Posner said all the things he never wrote, because you say so. It must be true : you can bold words ! If it's bold, it's right ! If Posner's title and entire post are about the Open Drug Act but, as an example, he uses an article on Gaucher, then the whole thing is about Gaucher. If you say so, it must be true.</p>
<p>Hey, it's all about'figurative' language, the new definition of which seems to be 'whatever I claim people to be saying without ever proving how or why'. Crafty, that.</p>
<p>Side note : you brought up the AARP. Not me. I asked what its relevance to this argument was. Still no intelligible or relevant answer except to invent more absurd accusations and conflating more unrelated issues to drown your (dead) fish. Read before you answer. Listen before you speak, you might come across as less of a troll.</p>
<p>By the way, you did make that claim. In bold, in your very first post. That you are now so keen to deny it will be sufficient for now. Thank you. </p>
<p>Oh and you could have saved yourself a lot of time by simply answering my previous question i.e. by admitting you only come here to engage in pseudo-moralistic posturing. Thank you for the generously extensive and hyper-ventilated confirmation. I am flattered by all the attention. (Although me thinks the one-letter pseudonymed person doth protest too much...)<br/>

<p>This is a lie. I do not even mention the AARP by name in my first post, let alone in bold. I refer to it implicitly while discussing the legislative prospects for Orphan Drug Act reform. I say:</p>
<p>Not only would changing such an act be costly, but finding energized and long-lasting constituents for it, even among its beneficiaries, would be difficult it not impossible. <i>Social Security reform, anyone?</i></p>
<p>I never say that the AARP is good, or that it is authoritative. Indeed, the first time I mention the word "AARP" it here:</p>
<p><i>Sylvain: Claiming that those who express such concerns somehow wish or prefer the death of specific groups is misguided, disingenuous, deceptive and, quite frankly, small-minded.</i> </p>
<p>And yet the AARP has succeeded in tabling Social Security reform <b>doing just that.</b> If you read my original post, you'd get that was the point!</p>
<p>In other words, I am agreeing that the AARP is "misguided, disingenuous, deceptive and, quite frankly, small-minded"; where I disagree is that the AARP has been <b>successful.</b> That doesn't mean I'm a supporter. The Nazis were successful in killing 6 million Jews; saying so doesn't mean I'm pro-Nazi. </p>

By the way, if Mr Becker has indeed said that the system should be 'considered as a whole' when discussing Social Security and Medicare, could it be because the latter are a wee bigger, more extensive, cost slightly more and touch a few more Americans than the Open Drug Act ? Might they - maybe - also have a somewhat larger economic and social impact on the US than this one Act ? </p>
<p>I don't know, I guess I'm just asking why some piece of legislation should be approached as if its study or amendment was the equivalent of reforming Social Security and other entitlements...Expecting consistency here would seem rather foolish.</p>

<p>This is an example of distorting what I wrote by selectively quoting it. What I wrote was this:</p>
<p><i>As always, Posner has clearly presented an economic analysis with <b>disastrous, provocative results</b>, and expected us to swallow the poison pill. His analysis is lucid, illuminating, and cautious and there is little with which to disagree.

<p>When I later state that Posner is "saying" XYZ, it's just a shorthand way of referring to the earlier post, quoted above. I did not mean to revise the original post, which refers to a claim obsfuscated, and replace it with the assertion that such a claim was <b>explicit and express.</b></p>

<p>I say that you don't read ANY newspapers not because you failed to read the Wall Street Journal article that prompted this post, which you now admit, but because you had no idea that the AARP was responsible for the ad campaign that tabaled President Bush's Social Security reform until 2009. That has, quite literally, been in every major American newspaper and on news television programs for months.</p>

<p>No you didn't address this above. You lectured about the meaning of the word 'obfuscate' and pontificated on the alleged deconstructions of others. You still have no justified the bolded claim of your first post. </p>
<p>Where did I just admit that I did not read that article ? Where, pray, did I do such thing ? This is truly fascinating. We are witnessing the manufacturing of yet another W 'fact'.</p>
<p>And where is the evidence that I did not know of the AARP and its Social Security proposal ? I asked what its relevance was to the Orphan Drug Act argument we are having. Since it has no relevance to it that I could think of, it stand to reason that I would ask what it is you were talking about. Which you never answered clearly. Now that this is finally clarified, however, I still have no idea why this is relevant to this argument, or how on Earth it can support your original claim.</p>
<p>Actually, I just wanted to start the debate since there hasn't been any yet. A litany of unsupported allegations is no debate. </p>

<p>Ok, first, Sally no offense but unless you find something to say that isn't about Sylvain's typo, please shut up.</p>
<p>Secondly, lets try to get back to the relevant issue.</p>
<p>As far as W's assertion about the intent of Posner's post, I feel that he goes too far in saying that Posner implies "society as a collective is better off if its weakest members are left slowly to die." In truth, Posner doesn't actually state his opinion on the matter and he merely poses a question.  There is some bias against the Orphan Drug act in his post, but that is probably to help us see why the legislation might not be seen as good.</p>
<p>W, you responded to my post about the issue not being the government's money by talking about how the government is the one funding this act and that being the source of the debate.  However, the issue is not whether the government should fund this act, it is whether the act should exist or not and to what level.  Posner's post does not refer to the cost to the government of implementing this act, it does mention costs to drug companies for financing R&amp;D for rare diseases.  The issue is not  "what should the government spend its money on?", the issue is should the government encourage spending on rare disease research and to what level.</p>
<p>My opinion to the first part of the question was stated in a previous post and is yes.  As to the second part, which Silvain and Ben both address as the primary focus, I don't really think a proper answer can be given without a thorough knowledge of the numbers inlvolved.       </p>

<p>I never made any assertions about the intent of Posner's post; Sylvain did in one of his attempts to distort my actual statements. But I will agree that "there is bias against the Ophran Drug Act in [Posner's] post." Is that bias explicit and express? No, it is obfuscated by the rigor of his analysis. As should be clear from reading my first post.</p>
<p>Ta: <i>However, the issue is not whether the government should fund this act, it is whether the act should exist or not and to what level.</i></p>
<p>You cannot separate whether the act should exist from whether the governmment should fund the act: those are two ways of saying the same thing -- the act cannt exist unless the government funds it. We are agreeing in substance and disagreeing in forms of words.</p>

<p>Interesting. "...And yet the rigorous analysis obfuscates his claim that society as a collective is better off if its weakest members are left slowly to die."</p>
<p>'His' being Posner. Most of the quote above being bolded in the original. The author being you, not me. </p>
<p>Nobody needs to do any 'attempts'. It's on the record. You did not complain about a mere 'bias' against the Act. You asserted that a) Posner believes society to be better off by letting some to die slowly, but b) that he obfuscated this 'claim' behind his 'analysis'. Which you also referred to in your preamble as a 'poison pill'.</p>
<p>That none of your posts has been able to justify this gross distortion of Posner's position is clear. That you would then flatly state you never made any such comment when confronted with it multiple times is beyond belief; that you would try to deflect the blame on others who have been holding you accountable for your misjudgment is simply unreal. </p>
<p>Unless 'leaving people to die slowly' was another of those figures of speech ?<br/>

<p><b>"...And yet the rigorous analysis obfuscates his claim that society as a collective is better off if its weakest members are left slowly to die."</b></p>
<p>This is not a statement of "intent." Your claim, Sylvain, is that one can infer intent from the fact of the cover-up. In other words, Posner is covering up his claim because Posner intended to make the claim. But I don't say that. Look above: Posner isn't doing the obfuscation here. The <b>rigorous analysis</b> is. I never claim Posner believes XYZ and does ABC because he believes XYZ (i.e., he has the specific intent to do ABC); I'm simply focusing on the claims, whether implicit or explicit, in his post.<br/>

<p>Ta: <i>The cost to the government is not the issue</i></p>
<p>Yes, it is, because you can't sanely pretend that the government does not fund the ODA. If the money from the ODA goes to something else (i.e., pork), the market for medicines of rare diseases would no longer exist, and that would hurt people with Gaucher's disease. The point is you can't obfuscate the direct harm this government choice will have on those people, when there are no guaranteed benefits on the other half of the scale. That private investment will dry up in the asbence of a viable market is just a way of describing the effect of the government canceling the ODA.</p>

<p>There is a serious flaw in your logic there.  My point which you don't address is that intent comes before enforcement.  My point is just as valid if you must, make it specific to criminal law, I assumed that you were capable of understanding that the same principal applies to civil law itsefl (just not for crime).</p>
<p>Anyway, you don't answer my question of where the majority of the money is coming from, the answer is the drug companies not the government.  I believe that the cost to the government is negligable as compared to the money being spent by the drug companies.  Your post about pork is relevant perhaps to breast cancer which the government I'm guessing directly funds, but not for this Orphan drug act.  <br/>

<p>No, there is no contradiction. I never said he "made a claim", either. I said that the claim was his. Do I think that any reasonable person using logic could fairly infer that such an implicit claim is a necessary implication of his explicit argument? Yes. Is it fair to call the claim "his"? Yes. Whether he specifically intended to put it there, however, I have no idea. I never say, because, frankly, I don't know. </p>
<p>I do think however, that he has specifically rigged a view of the costs in the way Ta has, and that such is obfuscatory. And that is exactly what I said. And I do think that implicit claims are more difficult to challenge, much liek taking over a company once a poison pill has been deployed. By the way, a poison pill is "a strategy, generally in business or politics, which attempts to avoid a negative outcome by increasing the costs of the negative outcome to those who seek it." </p>

<p>I said: "the rigorous analysis"</p>
<p>The difference is between Posner in the act of analyzing, i.e., his subjective view of what he is doing, and the analysis that Posner has done after the fact, which may acquire its own independent meaning.

<p>That assumes that legislation has intent. There's much scholarship to the contrary, i.e., that is a controversial view. I didn't respond to it, because that is a side-argument. I'm not going to get into an argument over Law and Disagreement by Jeremy Waldron right now. So: no logical flaw. Nothing illogical about avoiding irrelevant side-issues.</p>

This is just a way to shoe-horn in an argument about legislative intent that I already said was beside the point. Yes, I think there is a difference between the specific (subjective) intent of the author and the (objective) public meaning of his words. Most people accept this distinction, actually.

<p>Ta, it's all right. I seem to have been saying a lot of things that no one could find anywhere on this thread, least of all me. Like most people who grant themselves a great deal of license with the statements of others, inventing some if need be, W requires us in turn to abide by his own strict rules of interpretation when it comes to his own statements. </p>
<p>Which makes his latest and most clever justification rather equivocal, after all this back and forth. But I'll gladly take it as his admission that this bolded statement in his first post was only his interpretation of Posner's post, not Posner's claim.</p>
<p>It is a shame it took so long to get there and I'll take my share of responsibility for the prodigious amount of friction involved.</p>

<p>Ta: <i>Should drug companies should spend toward rare disease R&amp;D and if so to what level?</i></p>
<p>No, I don't think that is the question, as I have said before. But I would also note that capital need not invest in the pharamceutical industry. If the ODA is repealed, the government funding for the ODA would go to pork, and <b>the private sector monies might go toward investment in Disneyland.</b></p>
<p>Sylvain,<br/>
what you just linked to illustrates how you misinterpret what people say. In reconstructing numerous posts I had made, Ta said that I said "his intent is not his claim". I never said that, so I offered a better interpretation of what those numerous posts added up to. You can look up for other posts where I use the words "explicit" and "implicit" and "specific intent" and "subjective" and "objective". There is no attempt to deceive anyone.  I wasn't re-writing what is in bold in my first post, which I have said I still stand by numerous times. If I must repeat it again, my first post stands. </p>
<p><i>But I'll gladly take it as his admission that this bolded statement in his first post was only his interpretation of Posner's post, not Posner's claim.</i></p>
<p>This is game-playing with the word "claim." It is a claim implicit in Posner's post. I have no idea whether it was specifically intended. The only way you can suggest I think it is express and explicit is if you read my second post without reading the first, as I have said repeatedly.</p>

<p>W, please. Do not accuse anyone around here of game-playing with words. I'm afraid you lost that privilege about 40 posts ago. </p>
<p>Whether you like it or not is irrelevant; your repeated statements are clearly not conveying what you are now conveniently claiming to be saying. </p>
<p>Let's take another example, if you must insist. </p>
<p>"Contrary to your fiery rhetoric, it is a fact that Posner is saying society would be better off if the woman with Gaucher's disease [...] did not benefit from the Act...."</p>
<p>You did not write : "I believe it is implicit in Posner's statement that society..."</p>
<p>You did not write : "I think Posner is saying that society..." or "Posner's statements can be read as claiming..."</p>
<p>You did write that it was a 'fact' that Posner was saying something that he never, <i>in fact</i> said. </p>
<p>There was plenty of room here for you to use nuance between the implicit or the explicit, the subjective or the objective, to parse intent from interpretation etc. You used none of it. </p>
<p>Of course, it's obvious by now that you will never grant others the strict rules of interpretation you demand for your own prose.</p>
<p>Quit evading. At the very least, since I am not the only one to find your original statement grossly misguided - three of us, so far -  accept that you may be doing a singularly bad job communicating your case.</p>
<p>But I guess it's easier to blame others for 'misinterpretation' and manufacture bogus accusations in a vain attempt to shut them up than admitting a gross and very poorly worded exaggeration.</p>

<p>I know some of you remember me because I still get emails. I guess <br/>
maybe it is a cosmic coincidence that I am posting this today! </p>
<p>Im the guy with the delivery company--a couple of my guys parked <br/>
near the Dupont Scientology place, and the Scientologists went <br/>
crazy when they mentioned blinkers. The Scientologists have been <br/>
hassling me ever since then. </p>
<p>Well guess what I did? I went to that Scientology place on Monday <br/>
afternoon. </p>
<p>I took the metro as I know parking is a pain around there. </p>
<p>I ignored the people outside, walked in like I had business there. </p>
<p>A young man asked if he could help me. I told him who I was and <br/>
that I wanted to talk to someone in charge. His eyes got very big, <br/>
but he stayed calm. He asked me to have a seat and wait. </p>
<p>I sat and waited. I have to tell you that they have a very nice <br/>
place. I think it used to be a house. Someone obviously spent a <br/>
lot of money on it. </p>
<p>Well a woman came out and asked me to come with her. We went into <br/>
a little office. </p>
<p>She introduced herself, I wont give the name though. </p>
<p>By the way, I brought a yellow pad and made it clear I was going <br/>
to take notes. </p>
<p>I told her I wanted the harassment to stop. I layed out what had <br/>
happened, that they had been calling truck companies and had shown <br/>
up when I was doing a pickup and told the people there my company <br/>
was a bunch of religious bigots. </p>
<p>I told her as far as I knew the word blinker was the common term <br/>
for the flashing lights on a truck. </p>
<p>I told her that hassling a small business over a word is <br/>
ridiculous, and that if we could come to some kind of <br/>
understanding Id have to find another solution. I had thought <br/>
about taking the two guys with me but then I thought they might <br/>
have thought wed get violent. </p>
<p>She said shed wished Id made an appointment. I told her maybe <br/>
THEY should have made an appointment instead of just showing up <br/>
and hassling me. I also told her that I did look on their website <br/>
and it was not clear how to make appointments. </p>
<p>She asked me what I knew about blinkers and I asked her if she <br/>
meant not the truck kind and she said yes. I told her I had looked <br/>
on the web and it said that they were teleporting cats and that <br/>
they were either made from cat dna or that their dna was the basis <br/>
of cats. It also said that these cats are part of the invaders <br/>
that are part of Scientology religion. </p>
<p>She said that there are many advanced teachings in Scientology. <br/>
She asked me what religion I was and I would not tell her. She <br/>
asked why and I told her I was there to get to the bottom of this <br/>
and not to tell her my life story. She asked if I knew what was <br/>
meant by a religion having advanced teachings. I told her not <br/>
really. </p>
<p>She said in Scientology people come in at the level of preclear <br/>
and move up the bridge. She showed me a picture of this bridge, <br/>
there are many steps along the way to something called the OT <br/>
levels. She said that OT is Operating Thetan and is the highest <br/>
level. </p>
<p>She said along the way you have to learn various things and that <br/>
L. Ron Hubbard designed the bridge so you learned things as you <br/>
needed to learn them. </p>
<p>I asked her what the harm was in accidentally learning something <br/>
early--like learning about the blinkers. </p>
<p>She said and was very serious that there were cases where people <br/>
had learned things early and been harmed. She told me there was a <br/>
court case where some other things had been leaked and they took <br/>
steps to protect the judge who reviewed the leaked papers. </p>
<p>She also said that there are people who stole Scientology <br/>
materials and use them in something called the Free Zone. She said <br/>
that this violates the Scientology copyright. She told me that I <br/>
should have made an appointment with something called the <br/>
Religious Technology Center in Los Angeles but that since I was <br/>
not a Scientologist I might not have understood the web site. I <br/>
told her I did not know what that was and was certainly not going <br/>
to go to Los Angeles for no reason. </p>
<p>She said that the Religious Technology Center protects <br/>
Scientologys copyrights and makes sure that the material is used <br/>
as it was designed. I asked if it was like quality control and she <br/>
said yes. She said that Scientology is very precise and gets <br/>
results if it is applied as designed. I told her that made sense <br/>
but where was the harm in knowing about these blinker cats. In <br/>
fact, I told her, the guys on the truck did not even know that the <br/>
word blinker had anything at all to do with Scientology and that <br/>
maybe they should use less common words for such sensitive things. </p>
<p>She told me that she had no control over what things were called <br/>
that everything was based on the writings of L. Ron Hubbard. </p>
<p>I said well it is a good thing Hubbard didnt decide that the word <br/>
mover is not some other kind of monster or Id be in even more <br/>
trouble. I dont think she got the joke. She repeated what she <br/>
said about Hubbards writings. </p>
<p>I said well OK what happens now. I said you are harassing me for <br/>
what, because we parked near you, thats our right and because <br/>
someone said blinker? I think thats legal too. </p>
<p>She said that we did not have a parking permit. I told her we did <br/>
not need one. I told her Id been in the business for quite a <br/>
while, I know what permits I need. I also told her that if we had <br/>
a permit violation, DC should deal with us and not her and that it <br/>
had nothing to do with bigotry or religious secrets. </p>
<p>I told her that they have a special meaning for the word clear, is <br/>
it a problem if we say something is not clear or that glass is <br/>
clear? She said no as clear is not part of an advanced teaching. I <br/>
said thats nuts, how are people who are not Scientologists <br/>
supposed to know all of this? I said you are hassling my business <br/>
because someone said blinker. I said Catholics would not get upset <br/>
if we said cross or mass outside a church and Jews would not get <br/>
upset if you said pass over. </p>
<p>She said, and Im not kidding, that this was one good reason to <br/>
study Scientology. I said why, so people wont break some odd <br/>
rule? I told her that certain things were obviously offensive to <br/>
different religions but they were pretty well known. I also told <br/>
her I thought it was pretty rare for a religion to hassle someone <br/>
over something so minor. </p>
<p>Then she said well you posted this story of yours on the Internet. <br/>
She said you mentioned the blinkers. I said well yes I did as the <br/>
last time I checked America still had free speech. I told her they <br/>
post all kinds of stuff on the Internet and why are they better <br/>
than me. </p>
<p>She said well we dont post other religions advanced teachings or <br/>
make fun of them. I told her that if Im making fun of anything at <br/>
all Im making fun of their intolerance of the use of a common <br/>
word in its usual meaning. I told her that if theres any bigotry <br/>
going on it is against what seems to be some pretty serious <br/>
stupidity. I told her they had hassled me way more than I had <br/>
hassled them if I had even hassled them at all. I told her as far <br/>
as I knew no one had had any problems from hearing us say <br/>
blinkers. I asked her what would happen if a Scientologist went to <br/>
the store and someone said they had left their blinkers on and <br/>
they happened to hear it. </p>
<p>I asked her why, if this word is so dangerous or whatever that <br/>
something hasnt happened before. I asked her why if these cats <br/>
exist why hadnt the government done something about them. </p>
<p>At this point she said something about governments suppressing <br/>
Scientology but I interrupted her and just kept going. </p>
<p>I told her I could have lived the rest of my life and not had a <br/>
clue about these flying space cats if this had not happened. I <br/>
told her that there are lots of moves and deliveries in her area <br/>
and that they should be used to seeing this by now. I told her <br/>
that when all of the stuff for this building got moved in that <br/>
someone must have parked nearby to move it. </p>
<p>I told her Id had it. I told her she was costing me money and my <br/>
employees did not like being hassled and followed. I reminded her <br/>
that I was taking notes and that I was most certainly going to <br/>
post about the meeting. I told her if she had anything to say she <br/>
had better get with it and say it as Id heard about enough about <br/>
parking permits and dangerous advanced teachings. </p>
<p>She asked if the comment about dangerous advanced teachings was <br/>
making fun of Scientology and I said well maybe a little. I told <br/>
her Id been using the word for years and nothing had happened. I <br/>
told her that Id accept that they had advanced teaching but did <br/>
not see how they could be dangerous. I asked her if she could give <br/>
me any evidence of this danger and she said the danger was there <br/>
but she was not allowed to give me an examples. </p>
<p>I said well thats about it, what are you going to do about this? <br/>
I told her I was really upset and since the problem started here <br/>
in this building thats where Id come back to. </p>
<p>She asked me to wait outside while she made a phone call. I said <br/>
maybe a conference call would be best and she said no. She said <br/>
she would make a call and that she would have an answer for me at <br/>
the end of the call. </p>
<p>So I wandered around the lobby for about twenty minutes. I thought <br/>
they would watch me but if they were it was through hidden <br/>
cameras. But maybe not, as another woman came up and asked if she <br/>
could help me and I told her I was in a meeting with the other <br/>
woman, they do not seem to be all that organized, and there were a <br/>
lot of people wandering around in there. </p>
<p>Well she came back out and asked me to come back into the office. <br/>
She said she had been talking to people at the Religious <br/>
Technology Center about me. She said the disclosure of the <br/>
advanced teaching about blinkers was recent and a major concern of <br/>
theirs. She said it was a policy order that anyone not in good <br/>
standing and disseminating data about blinkers was subject to a <br/>
suppressive person declaration. Thats pretty much what she said <br/>
and yes I did ask her what it meant. </p>
<p>She said that it meant that in order to control the flow of <br/>
information about advanced teachings that persons doing so without <br/>
authorization were declared as suppressive. I told her I was not <br/>
suppressing anything. She said that I was suppressing Scientology. <br/>
I said well what happens now. </p>
<p>She said there were various procedures. She said I really should <br/>
consider becoming a Scientologist in good standing as that would <br/>
be the easiest way to get the suppressive declare revoked. I said <br/>
I was not about to convert to her religion over this. She said <br/>
then I needed to go ahead and make amends in the form of overts <br/>
and withholds although she said it is hard to do this if you are <br/>
not a Scientologist. </p>
<p>I told her I was having nothing to do with their rules and <br/>
procedures. I said you people are after me because we parked near <br/>
your building and used a common word which you think is some <br/>
secret religious code word or something. She said that ever since <br/>
the first disclosure of the blinker teaching there had been a lot <br/>
of calls into Scientology about it. </p>
<p>I told her I had nothing to with the discovery of this teaching. I <br/>
said if it is so secret then how did someone find out about it. <br/>
She said well sometimes people steal documents and leak them. She <br/>
said in this case it seems someone had bought confidential <br/>
documents at a garage sale. She said this person posted about the <br/>
blinkers and other things. </p>
<p>She said that this person then sold the documents to a known <br/>
suppressive person even though they offered her a fair price for <br/>
the documents. </p>
<p>Now I will be honest and say that by now I know about that but did <br/>
not know about it before. I told her. She said well see thats the <br/>
problem. People talk about these teachings and it causes problems. </p>
<p>I said well you caused this problem. If you had not been taking <br/>
pictures of my guys and then having a fit when one of them said <br/>
blinker none of this ever would have happened. </p>
<p>She said people come and protest there and expose teachings. She <br/>
showed me some pictures of people with picket signs that looked <br/>
like aliens. She said the alien signs were making fun of other <br/>
advanced teachings. She said she had seen the blinker pictures on <br/>
the internet and it was more of the same. I said well I never made <br/>
any blinker pictures. </p>
<p>She told me that the Religious Technology Center had told her that <br/>
they could arrange a special price if everyone in my company would <br/>
at least do some basic processing. I said I am not going to <br/>
convert over this and it is illegal for me to even suggest it to <br/>
my employees. </p>
<p>Then she started telling me that Scientology is compatible with <br/>
all other religions and you really dont have to convert if you <br/>
dont want to. I told her it would still be illegal for me to even <br/>
suggest any kind of religious training or whatever it is to my <br/>
employees. She said that the suppressive person declaration <br/>
applies to all of you and it is your choice of what to do. </p>
<p>I stood up. I told her well it is my choice to post something <br/>
about this meeting to the internet. I told her that if you keep <br/>
messing with me I will find some way to deal with it. I told her <br/>
that if they want to believe in aliens and flying cats with alien <br/>
dna and so on it is fine but when a guy talks about blinkers on a <br/>
truck it is no big deal. </p>
<p>I told her that if it did not cost so much to repaint the trucks <br/>
Id rename the company Blinker Van Lines. She had an obvious <br/>
nervous reaction to this! </p>
<p>So Ill keep you good people informed. Im still not giving out <br/>
the the name of the company but I do appreciate all of the good <br/>
wishes. But if you see an ad for a blinker special you will know <br/>
it is me! </p>
