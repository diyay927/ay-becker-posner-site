			NOTE: Posner and I believe that we should place more emphasis on  events of interest to the international community. So we will discuss international issues more frequently, starting with our entries on China.


China�s economic growth since it freed agriculture from the oppressive hand of government has been spectacular, averaging some 7-10 per cent per year in real GDP since 1980, even allowing for some inflation in the official numbers. It has becoming a leading destination of foreign investment, one of the world�s biggest exporters, and among the largest users of oil and other natural resources.

Its potential seems to be so limitless, after awakening from a slumber that lasted for centuries, that many are already forecasting that China will replace the United States during the 21st century as the leading economic power. Perhaps these forecasts will be correct-my crystal ball is very cloudy- but some cautionary comments are needed because we have heard that tune before. 

The �German miracle� after World War II was so impressive that many forecast Germany would overtake the United States rather quickly, in part because Germany supposedly discovered a new way to organize economic society- a � social contract� among workers and companies- that would propel that nation past America�s old fashioned capitalism. But Germany began to flounder in the 1980�s, did much worse in the 1990�s, and is considered by many now to be the �sick man� of the European Union.

 Krushchev�s prophesy in the late 1950�s that the USSR would �bury� the US was not about military victory but economic superiority. This was made when Soviet official statistics showed extremely rapid economic growth. The apparent miracle of Soviet growth suggested to the great economists Joseph Schumpeter and Paul Samuelson, and many others that central planning might be superior economically to capitalism and decentralization of economic power.

The latest case prior to China is Japan, which experienced impressive economic growth from the early 1950�s into the late �80�s that propelled Japan into the elite club of the richest economic powers. Japan too had supposedly discovered a new approach of consensus capitalism with a long-term business outlook that was allegedly superior to old Adam Smith varieties of competitive capitalism. This alleged superiority of the Japanese system was extolled in a series of articles by the very good economist Alan Blinder, and in books with various titles, such as �The Japan That Can Say No�. Yet Japan basically stagnated since the early 1990�s, and now the concern is whether it can ever come out of this stagnation and deflation (I am confident it will eventually). It�s economic  model now seems riddled with inefficiencies and drawbacks, and is no longer considered a new wave of capitalism.

None of this proves that China will not be an exception, and continue to grow well beyond other nations, but these examples do suggest caution in conceding the next 50 years or so to China�s economy. Countries invariably discover that it is much easier to grow rapidly when they are economically way behind since they could then import the knowledge embodied in technology and human capital developed by leading countries. As a country begins to catch up to the knowledge frontier, a simple transfer of knowledge is no longer productive. It then has to participate in the generation of new technologies and approaches, which is far harder than simply using advances made elsewhere.

To be sure, China has considerable strengths that should enable it to grow relatively rapidly for much longer. China has an abundant, hard-working, and ambitious labor force. The government also radically liberalized the incredibly rigid labor markets under its old style central planning toward flexible markets that allow companies to hire and fire easily. Also workers now have the freedom, they did not before, to find jobs that best suit their talents and interests. China has opened its economy to foreign investments and domestic entreprenuers, something the Soviet Union, Japan, or even Germany never really did, and China has been learning from the new technologies brought by these investors. 

China has also created a highly competitive environment in most markets, where companies have flexibility to change prices as costs change, and as competitors alter their prices and terms of sale. China�s long history of great respect for knowledge and scholars has returned. Even poor families now sacrifice their meager resources to insure their children a decent education and other investments in human capital.

During the past couple of decades, China has been blessed with far-sighted leaders that have generally wisely approached liberalizing its economy. They started off with relatively simple steps that gave farmers greater freedom to decide what to produce on their small private plots, and to sell their output at more market-based prices. After seeing the overwhelming success of these first steps, they gradually liberalized much of the rest of the economy, allowing workers freedom to choose jobs, employers freedom to determine hiring and firing, markets freedom to set most wages and prices, foreign investors to start factories, often in partnership with local governments, and stock exchanges to develop in Shanghai and elsewhere. Meanwhile, the mainland has largely lived up to its agreement to give considerable economic autonomy to Hong Kong. 

This rapid development of the Chinese economy has provided many benefits to the US and other rich economies. Chinese has exported clothing, toys, simple electronics, and many other labor-intensive goods at prices far below those possible without China�s development. China�s growth helps provide a much larger and richer market for the knowledge-intensive products and services produced by rich nations, such as cars, computers, drugs and medical instruments, kitchen appliances, and many others.

China�s development so far poses economic problems mainly not for the advanced nations, but for developing nations that produce the same types of labor-intensive products as China does. These nations include Mexico, Pakistan, Brazil, and some countries of Africa. It is a general but sometimes neglected result in trade theory that the growth of a large nation will raise world GDP per capita, but can hurt the nations that are most similar to the growing nation. 

Richer nations could be hurt eventually if China continues to move up the product ladder. It would then produce and export more knowledge-intensive products, partly made possible by China�s disrespect for property rights, intellectual property, and patent protection laws. But even so, I believe that rich nations will generally benefit from China�s progress since different richer nations generally specialize in different types and varieties of products and services. Moreover, as China gets richer, it will provide even larger markets for exports from other nations.

But to return to the main theme, as with Russia, Germany, and Japan, it is not inevitable that China will continue to grow rapidly enough to equal or surpass eventually the growing per capita incomes of the US and Western Europe. For like the other nations that looked unstoppable, China has serious problems, and other problems might surface as it becomes richer.

China has a disastrous capital market, with government banks that have been forced to make loans to inefficient public companies. The result has been hundreds of billions of dollars of debt that will never be repaid, and are now being auctioned off. Perhaps that debt overhang will be rapidly absorbed, but Japan suffered for more than decade with a huge supply of bad bank debt that they did not absorb efficiently; indeed, the government has continued to encourage the creation of more bad debt.

China still has many highly inefficient public enterprises that authorities are reluctant to close because they fear discontent from laid off workers. These enterprises can stay in business only because they receive uneconomic loans from other state enterprises; namely, the banks. China does not have a developed system of commercial laws, and shows little respect for intellectual property rights. This may well be a rational strategy for a developing nation that is mainly using knowledge originated elsewhere, but this strategy becomes a drawback as a country becomes richer, and must begin to participate itself in the production of new knowledge.

Authoritarian regimes can do well economically when they have good leaders, but they can produce disasters when these leaders have foolish economic ideas. China discovered this under Mao, with his incredible �great leap forward� that helped kill millions of rural Chinese. While the evidence indicates that authoritarian regimes do not grow slower on average than democratic governments, they do have more unstable growth rates than democracies. I believe China will become more democratic if it continues to grow rapidly, but economic progress could falter badly if they select poor leaders who have strange ideas about how economies should be organized.

China has had a much faster decline in birth rates to below-replacement levels than other developing nations, no doubt helped by its so-called one child policy. This has meant a prematurely aging population that creates a burden on its evolving social security and health systems as relatively few young persons one way or another have to �finance� the care of increasing numbers of elderly. 

The rapid fertility decline also greatly slowed its population growth, which may have looked attractive in a poor Malthusian-style economy. But knowledge-based economies often thrive on larger populations because of what economists call increasing returns to scale in the production of new knowledge, and in the degree of specialization in different types of human capital. While exports to the world�s population provide some offsets to declines in a country�s population, domestic populations are much more important usually in determining the advantages of investments in knowledge and human capital.

A more intangible but important factor is that as countries get richer, they often introduce policies that retard further progress. This happened in Germany with legislation that made labor very costly, and ossified its labor and retirement markets. It happened in Japan that kept many regulatory restrictions on services, on foreign investments and immigration, and maintained a protected and inefficient banking system. It can surely happen also in China in ways that are difficult to forecast at this early stage of its development.

I am not saying that China will not become the leading economic nation, but rather that it is far too early to tell. The many failed predictions about Japan and other nations should make us modest about such long-term predictions. Perhaps India will become the leader-it has strengths (and weaknesses) that China lacks- or maybe Brazil if it can finally get its act together. 

Or indeed, perhaps the US will continue to be the most dynamic economy. Many economists and others wrote off this economy during the 1970�s and some of the �80�s when productivity growth declined and the economy faltered. Since I do not believe countries necessarily age the way species do, the US can continue to do well- productivity started growing rapidly about 10 years ago- if it provides a good environment for new companies, flexible labor and product markets, sizeable investments in human capital and technology, and an open attitude to new ideas, immigrants, and different ways. Those of you alive in 20-30 years will be able to discover if my skepticism and analysis will be borne out by events.
