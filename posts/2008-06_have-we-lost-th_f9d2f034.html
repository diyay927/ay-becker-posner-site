<h3>Have We Lost the Moral Values That Undergird a Commercial Society?--Posner</h3>
<p>David Brooks is one of the most thoughtful newspaper columnists. In a recent op-ed ("The Great Seduction," <em>New York Times</em>, June 10, 2008, p. A 23), he argues that the founders of the nation  "built a moral structure around money. The Puritan legacy inhibited luxury and self-indulgence. Benjamin Franklin spread a practical gospel that emphasized hard work, temperance and frugalityâ¦For centuries, [the nation] remained industrious, ambitious and frugal." But, Brooks continues, over the past 30 years much of that legacy "has been shredded," while "the institutions that encourage debt and living for the moment have been strengthened.â"And here he mentions "an explosion of debt that inhibits social mobility and ruins lives," because of "people with little access to 401(k)'s or financial planning but plenty of access to payday lenders, credit cards and lottery agents." Among other "agents of destruction" are state lotteries--"a tax on stupidity," which tells people "they don't have to work to build for the future. They can strike it rich for nothing." Other culprits are the astronomical interest rates charged by payday lenders; and the aggressive marketing of credit cards by banks and other financial institutions, as a result of which by the time college students are in their senior year more than half of them have at least four different credit cards. The cures that Brooks offers include "rais[ing] consciousness about debt," encouraging foundations and churches to offer short-term loans in competition with payday lenders, strengthening usury laws, and taxing consumption rather than income, thus encouraging saving.</p>
<p>All this is very interesting, but is it correct? I have my doubts, except about the desirability of eliminating double taxation of savings, a problem with our income tax.</p>
<p>Max Weber argued convincingly in his famous book <em>The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism </em>that the frugality and industriousness promoted by the early Protestants in opposition to the opulence of the Roman Catholic Church were values conducive to and perhaps critical in the rise of commercial society. Protestants who believed in predestination wanted to show by their modesty, austerity, and avoidance of lavish display that they were predestined for salvation.</p>
<p>But saving plays a less important role in economic progress today than it did in the sixteenth century. Its role in powering economic growth has been taken over, to a large extent, by technology. The great rise in standards of living worldwide is due far more to technological progress than to high rates of savings, that is, to deferring consumption.</p>
<p>At the same time, now that we have efficient debt instruments that in former times did not exist or were extremely costly, the role of personal debt (Brooks does not criticize corporate or government debt) in human welfare is more apparent than it was. Apart from its role in solving short-term liquidity problems resulting from delay in the receipt of income, debt enables consumption to be smoothed over the life cycle. Without debt, a family might have to wait 20 years before it could afford to buy a house. Of course, debt creates risk for both lender and borrower, as the subprime mortgage crisis has dramatically illustrated. But if the risks are understood, it is unclear why the assumption of them should be thought harmful to personal or social welfare. At worst, debt leads to bankruptcy, but bankruptcy is not the end of the world either for the borrower or for the lender.</p>
<p>In situations of desperate poverty, one can expect a heavy debt load; but such a load can also be positively correlated with prosperity, which cushions the risks that debt creates. It is especially odd to suggest as Brooks does that taking on debt is antithetical to hard work; on the contrary, it increases the incentive to work hard by making it at easier for people to obtain the goods and services they want by borrowing the money they need to pay for them, yet at the same time increasing the risk of bankruptcy should they slack off on their work and so let their income fall.</p>
<p>The very high interest rates for payday loans tell us that many people will pay a very high premium to shift consumption from future to present. As long as they understand what interest rates are and what interest rates they are paying, it is hard to see why their preference for present over future consumption, and hence for spending and borrowing rather than saving, should have social implications. People who take out payday loans are unlikely to be potential savers (i.e., lenders); and by taking on heavy debt they force themselves to work very hard; and I have suggested that saving is not as important as it once was.</p>
<p>I particularly do not understand how, if high interest rates for payday loans are a problem, loans by foundations and churches are a solution. If, as I assume Brooks must mean, these loans are to made be at lower interest rates than payday loans, the former payday borrowers will borrow more. If to try to prevent this the charitable lenders ration their credit tightly, the payday borrowers will borrow what they can from those lenders and top off with a payday loan; their total debt burden is unlikely to fall.</p>
<p>As for the "tax on stupidity," it is of course irresistible to finance as much as government as possible by a system of voluntary taxation, which is what a state lottery is. And I donât think "stupid" is the right word to describe all or even most of the people who buy lottery tickets. I do think that some of them consider themselves "lucky" and so in effect recalculate the odds in their favor. That is stupid; in a game of chance, "luck" is randomly distributed. Some people, though, simply enjoy risk. Others like to daydream, and a daydream is more realistic if there is some chance it may come true, even if a very small chance. And finally and most interestingly, there are people whose marginal utility of income is U-shaped rather than everywhere declining. Usually we think of it as declining: my second million dollars confers less utility on me than my first million, and that is why I would not pay a million dollars for a lottery ticket that gave me a 50.1 percent or probably even an 80 percent probability of winning $2 million. But maybe I lead a rather drab life, and this might make such a gamble rational even if it were not actuarially fair. Suppose that for a $2 lottery ticket I obtain a one in a million chance of winning $1 million. It is not a fair gamble because the expected value of $1 million discounted by .000001 is $1, not $2. But if having $1 million would transform my life, the expected utility of the gamble may exceed $2, and then it is rationally attractive.</p>
<p>Brooks complains that government sponsorship of lotteries sends an official and therefore authoritative message that a person can strike it rich for nothing. But of course that is true, even when there are no lotteries. (And he gives no indication of wanting to forbid private lotteries.) You can inherit great wealth. More commonly, you may be able to leverage modest talents into great wealth by the luck of being in the right job at the right time. Brooks himself complains in his op-ed about the message sent by the fact that hedge fund managers often make more money than people who "build a socially useful product." Only the latter, he believes, should earn fortunes. But he doesn't propose an excess-profits tax on hedge fund managers; he accepts the legitimacy of their fortunes at the same time that he attributes those fortunes to luck. There is also an echo of the traditional but erroneous suspicion of speculation as an activity that does not create social wealth but merely shifts it around. That is incorrect. Speculation aligns prices (whether commodity prices or the prices of companies) with values and so creates more accurate signals for production and investment. It is a vital economic service. That is not to say that speculators "deserve" higher incomes than ditch diggers. Desert doesn't enter. Incomes are determined by supply and demand.</p>
<p>What is true is that easy credit facilitates bubbles, such as the housing bubble and the related mortgage-financing bubble, and the bursting of a bubble can, as we have been relearning recently, cause economic dislocations. This may require some regulatory adjustments; it does not require a return to Calvinism.</p>

<p>You've neglected to mention the largest societal negatives of the lottery:</p>
<p>1) All the costs of people playing the lottery too often. (For example problem gamblers may become depressed, become less adept at socializing at work or at home, and at worst, engage in criminality or suicide.)<br/>
2) The direct costs of administering the lottery.<br/>
3) The cost of having large numbers of people working for lottery corporations, instead of productive work. Compare, for example, government funding for the arts: here, as in lotteries, governments are often paying a large portion of those workers salaries, but lottery workers produce absolutely nothing which society values, while artists produce art, which is highly valued.</p>
<p>Lowering those costs ought to be a priority for goverments, because they are a drain on the productivity of an economy, with very little benefits. Governments however, only seem to promote its expansion, looking only at the increase in their revenues, without contemplating fully the true financial and social costs. (Of course, it should not be eliminated: gambling is a natural, human passtime. If people gamble, why not have it benefit governments, rather than unscrupulous people?)</p>

<p>Unfortunately the idea that technology can replace savings and capital as a source of growth has been put to a rather more serious challenge than perhaps you realize, primarily by development economists who have a quite rigorous set of theories.  First the savings still have to come from somewhere, and second there is growing work on the effectiveness of different kinds of savings.  The Commission on Growth and Development recently completed its report which generally mirrors the consensus among economists and practitioners concerned with creating growth.  It included the fact that foreign investment is a poor substitute for domestic savings.  The creation of technology still requires capital that originates as savings.  </p>
<p>In addition however I agree with you that the Brooks column is somewhat misguided, but I believe it misses a fundamental point.  The impoverished are generally in debt and these are the people who are frequenting payday lenders and have too many credit cards with interest charging balances.  That fact hasn't changed from 17th century men selling themselves into indentured servitude, and there are aspects to the early founding of this country showing that many early settlers were in fact in debt, but wanted to keep from being thrown in debtors prison or losing their freedom.  Nonetheless the savings rate in this country was positive and significant for the period until the last 30 years and this is a problem.  Clearly debt has moved up the income scale to the solidly middle class which is not because suburban families were tempted by payday lenders.  It is because every time the economy needed a boost it turned to consistently responding American consumers who were deceived by a artificially inflated stores of value in home equity and overpriced dollars.  And of course Greenspan always told us that neither could possibly be overpriced in such free markets.</p>
<p>And please if you want to tax consumption do it in a useful way- advocate instituting a federal VAT.</p>

<p>  I have not read Mr. Brooks' article but I'm not sure I would accept his premise.<br/>
  The Puritan ethic was, at best, a necessary transitory state in the development of the national's commerical ethos.  By the time of our nation's founding, the overwhelming desire to see everything through the prism of religion was replaced with individuals (many of whom were Deists and viewed God as merely a vestigial presence) <br/>
substituting religion with reason.    <br/>
  With the coming of the subsequent industrial age capitalism, and its attandant wealth, attained unprecedented heights.  The result was guilt-free consumption in the present rather than using savings to "buy" one's way in to the next world.  <br/>
  A nation whose culture was consistent with the Puritan ethic never would have become what we were in the 19th century and what--for better or for worse--we are today.</p>

<p>Playing the lottery is stupid? What's stupid is forced participation in Social Security. The life expectancy of a black American male is 66, meaning that the government expects him to die the year he qualifies for Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>I've calculated that if the government had forced him instead to put his SS premium each month on a single spin of a roulette wheel and invest whatever winnings in the S&amp;P, when he died at 66, the man would have over $2,000,000 to leave to his heirs. The way it is now, the fruits of his lifelong premiums are probably dedicated to subsidizing the SS benefits of some white woman who never worked a day in her life. </p>

<p>Brooks' article was a fine addition to Fathers Day.  Each generations of fathers have been telling the next generation how they aren't as industrious and thrifty as need be.<br/>
The fact is that today we can do and get things more easily than in the past.  In the early 20th century, you needed to work harder or you'd starve.  It wasn't some philosophy or religion of industriousness, it was being hungry and cold that motivated one to work hard.  Now, food is plentiful and most buildings are climate controlled.  Add to that the present and growing expanse of service industries, those that do for you what you don't feel like doing.  In the past, most every job (excepting menial or manual labor) had to be done by the one needing it done.  Today, you can outsource, subcontract, temp, etc., most every task.  The goals of production, and of self-accomplishment, are being replaced by the goal of maximum delegation to others.<br/>
My more cynical viewpoint is, that with all these comments about industrious Puritans, reforming Protestants, and the opulence of Catholics - whether allowing mixed marriages was the first step down the slippery slope.</p>

<p>A bagatelle, perhaps, but I have noticed a proliferation of sentences like this: "David Brooks is one of the most thoughtful newspaper columnists."  It seems to me, the normal use of words like "most", "funniest", "best", is to signify the one thing at the pinnacle.  If I am right, it is incorrect to say "one of the most thoughtful", since there can only be one most thoughtful.  Additionally, since I recognized and tried to fix my overuse of phrases of the kind, I have noticed myself dialing down hyperbole, which I often overuse.  </p>

<p>Paul, As for grammar issues, perhaps Mark Twain put it best, "Kill the adjectives". </p>
<p>Now, on to the meat of the subject. All of this seems to prove Aristotle correct when he said, "Ethics is the practical end of philosophy". Where else can one study the details and relationships between; Good and Evil, Right and Wrong, Virtue and Vice? Important issues across time and space; making Man the measure of all things. One important question that needs to be answered is, "Why did God in his inifinte wisdom create seven vices and only four virtues and make those vices so much more pleasurable than the virtues?" When in the end all he really wants is for the Good to prevail. So much for Calvin. </p>
<p>As a kid in church on Sunday, I always wondered why if it was that the Lords Prayer, that some had trespasses and others had debts. One day it occured to me, Ah-ha! that's because some are landholders and others business people with commercial interests. The awakening of the understanding of economic factors through Religion in the child's mind. My, this religion stuff can be important! The question now becomes, "How is it to be directed to socially beneficial uses by religion and morally acceptable goals?" Calvin had one approach, but there are many others.</p>
<p>Concurrent with this theme, is the issue of socially acceptable ethics and codes of morality outside of the Judeo-Christian experience. Some going back as far as 600 BC and earlier. Any one remember Aseop and the fable of "The Grasshopper and the Ant? A simple story of frugality and hardwork guaranteeing survival. What happened to the Grasshopper who played and fiddled all the summer while the Ant industriously worked all the summer day? The Grasshopper died when winter struck and he had no means of support, but the Ant sat snug in his home that was well provided. </p>
<p>Perhaps a parable for our own times?  </p>

<p>Jimbino! Whew! that was quite an outburst of seemingly unsupportable pap!  Let's take a look:</p>
<p>"Consider life expectancy. In 1992, the life expectancy of a person born in the U.S. was 76 years. It was 74 for Black women, 65 for Black men, 80 for white women, and 73 for white men. Thus, white people will live, on the average, 7 years longer than Black people. Startlingly, in 1990 two researchers found that the life expectancy for a Black man in Harlem was lower than for a man in Bangladesh."  </p>
<p>......... Now it IS a shame that in this "richest of nations" the poor of "Harlem" or even rural pockets? blankets? of poverty share a much lower life span regardless of skin color. The above is 15 year old data so it's perhaps on the low side but it looks as though average lifespan for "blacks" is nearly 70.   And relevant to your claim that SS is a bad deal for them it would be good to look into how many of those dying prematurely and dragging down the averages were on SS disability for a number of years.  Also, it would be excellent if you provided the amount paid in by lower income folk as the "deal" is quite a bit better for those of lower incomes than for those of upper incomes.</p>
<p>BTW I've taken a few playful spins of the roulette wheel; you know nothing of investment grade of course, but have nothing to show for my spins except a "free" drink or so.  Could you tell us how you managed to get such a positive return out of a negative sum game?  I've always been under the impression that a game returning even 95% of the "investment" per spin would eat away at one's capital pretty rapidly over a week or so.  Have I been wrong all this time?</p>
<p>Oh.......... could you clear something else up for me?  It seems there has been a recent "fad?" of "borrowing" some several billion from the SS fund that had been designated to help us through the boomer retirement period. I guess the rate of return to the SS fund IS very low, perhaps even zero?  But were we not lending ourselves money cheap, wouldn't we have to borrow it at higher rates from those actually willing to lend at market rates?   Thanks! Jack</p>

<p>CRF Good points.  I've no moral objections to lotteries and other forms of gambling but we do need to keep in mind that it's "entertainment" and a parasite on our true economy.  I put quotes on "entertainment" as I think gambling a bit suspect even there.  Somehow there seems a difference between paying to gamble and paying to ensure that talented singers, actors and sports figures can ply their entertaining crafts.  </p>
<p>I guess that in the state of our current economy those you mention working in the field would otherwise be unemployed and perhaps they should be included in a figure of un- or under-employment. </p>
<p>I too think lotteries and the like are a poor means of a governing body raising money for schools etc.  As Posner sort of points out (and travel to poor nations confirms) it's those who've little hope of improving their standard of living who are most prone to take a chance on games of poor odds.</p>

<p>What is it that I am missing here? Haven't prices risen inexorably since Keynesianism was adopted after WWII? Isn't Keynesianism inexorably inflationary? Aren't the government and the private sector equally responsible for continuing to deficit spend (borrow, credit, whatever you wish to call it)? The politicians are constantly pandering to "You deserve everything". The commercial sector is constantly doing the same, "You deserve not to have pimples". Is it possible that early Americans were relying on phiosophical and religious proscriptions against extravagance based on historical experience? And now we have a government which doesn't have the political will do stabilize the cost-price-value curve and a population which is totally materialistic. Now we have influential thinkers saying that is just fine. Great! Personally, I lean toward Ravi Batra's view in his "Great American Deception" and that of Marvin Harris in "Why nothing works".</p>
<p>By the by, I wonder what the asset ratio is between 60 to 80 year olds to 40 to 60 year olds now compared to some previous years, say 1920 and 1960 and how much asset transfer is going on before death between those age groups.</p>
<p>Best regards to all.</p>

<p>Oh, David Brooks. How silly you are. I guess it's too much to ask for a thorough review in an article, and blaming the decline in morality and/or intelligence is always a favorite topic of older crowd. [You're a moron. Just ask anyone older than you.] <br/>
The real answer for the decline is probably far more complex. Perhaps the rise of cheap money over the last half-century has made saving less attractive [fractional reserve banking and monetary policy in general] while the last century has also seen a huge rise in per-capita income. [I distrust the median income number in the US because the influx of immigrants keeps adding people on the lower side of the median, and yet the median holds steady or rises.] In such an environment, it makes perfect sense to borrow early, and then work. If your income rises faster than the interest rate, which was likely, you'd simply get your stuff faster and still save money over, say, renting until you have saved enough to buy a house. <br/>
As for the need for the Puritan work ethic or protestant ethos, I highly doubt it's necessary to a successful commercial society, though I also doubt it's damaging. If it were necessary, the Chinese would be doomed, as would Japan, India, Dubai, the very successful Baltic states, or all of Southeast Asia. The necessary ethos is a government that respects property rights and the rule of law. The rest tends to take care of itself, subject to luck and circumstance.</p>

<p>Just one or two other comments:</p>
<p>Judge Posner, what is the difference between moral values which undergird commercialism and other moral values? It has always been my impression that morality was based on adhering to natural law, an adherence of questionable strength in our society.</p>
<p>It would be interesting, if not already done, for economists to study the optimum point of balance between credit (all forms of public and private borrowing), prices, capital creation, and employment as well as what elements and how many of them will cause disequillibrium between those elements. I suspect that the answer is "Not many". Just as in any social organism, a small number of deviants can throw the entire enterprise out of kilter and even if it doesn't kill it, the organisim (organization) will spend enormous energy trying to recover and maintain some normality.</p>

<p>Jack,</p>
<p>The American Black male has a life expectancy of about 70 years in 2008: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293008,00.html</p>
<p>The expected return on a $1 bet in roulette is about 95 cents: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette</p>
<p>The average wage of an American Black is about $2500 per month:<br/>
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/daily/graphics/raceWages_101804.html</p>
<p>FICA tax takes about 15.3% of his monthly earnings, or about $380. Thus a Black male forced to invest the proceeds from a single spin of a roulette wheel every month would be investing, on average, about $360 per month in something like the S&amp;P 500, which has grown historically at a rate of 7% or so.</p>
<p>Letâs assume the Black American male starts work at 18 and works until retirement at age 67, when he would have been entitled to draw SS benefits for the remaining 3 years of his life at about $1500 per month. Under my roulette scheme, when he retires at age 67, he will have worked 49 years and his S&amp;P account will have accumulated $1,699,074, giving him a monthly income, from the dividends, of some $9551 per month, and, when he dies at age 70, his heirs will get the $1,699,074. </p>
<p>Of course, under different assumptions, the results will vary, but anyone can see that Social Security is a very bad deal for the Black American. Furthermore, paying the premium every month is a lot less fun than a spin of the roulette wheel.</p>

<p>Usury (in the original sense of any interest) was at times denounced by a number of religious leaders and philosophers in the ancient world, including Plato, Aristotle, Cato, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarch, Aquinas, Muhammad, Moses, Philo and Gautama Buddha.<br/>
The above comment was taken from Wikipedia.  Once again Judge Posner has thrilled me!  First, he referenced Max Weber, father of Public Administration, which I am studying, so I was excited to see Weber's name in a Posner post.  Secondly, I learned about NYT columnist David Brooks whom I had never read before...in his book "On Paradise Drive How We Live Now and Always" (2004) I learned about Jewish Buddhist Taoists -- I believe I met one working on the Hillary Clinton Campaign so illumination into this concept was of interest.  Third, I had not thought about usury since law school and the Wikipedia article is interesting.  Posner and Becker like to do the math thing with lottery behavior...doing the math thing with poor people looking for a shot out of destitution and fear doesn't really work too well.  Gambling is not a productive behavior from any perspective whether it is a state lottery, a craps table in Vegas, or some might say, playing the stock market.  I like the Ben Franklin concepts of hard work, temperance and savings.  Today, many are into this type of thinking and behavior ... they have names like Eckert Tolle and Jack Kornfield and even Mary Ann Williamson.  Limited gambling is a form of entertainment for some.  Taking $20 to buy 20 lottery tickets replaces the movie and popcorn but doesn't give the purchaser three hours of entertainment; maybe only one hour.  Also, no new knowledge, or personal insight, or giggles, or the opportunity to talk to someone else who has seen the movie thus forging a new friendship are forgone with the purchase of lottery tickets.  For some there will be a hangover from the behavior:  buyer's remorse or winner's mania.  There is a segment of our population who have serious gambling problems ... Someone wrote about a clerk being able to keep up with Judge Posner.  For Judge Posner a day without reading and writing would probably be a miserable hell.  He is a fortunate man in that he has found his bliss.  I would guess that he would prefer reading and writing over just about any other activity .... he would find sitting at a slot machine all day dreadful.  The pay day lenders are doing business with people who are living on the edge ... maybe they are addicts (alcohol, nicotene, drugs), maybe no one ever sat down and taught them how to shop (walk that extra block to the 99 cent store for 99 cent green beans instead of buying $2 green beans at the more posh Albertsons).  Maybe they are depressed like the author of the Harry Potter books (although her gamble was in the writing and submission of a book which paid off royaly).  I guess we all gamble every day in some way...the payday lenders and credit card companys may just be the biggest predators.<br/>

<p>Jimbino..... "Of course, under different assumptions, the results will vary,"</p>
<p>Indeed they will.  </p>
<p>First while we retired him in today's dollars 49 years ago his wages would most likely have been barely above the min wage; less than $200/month and perhaps his employment history would have been........ less than steady.  </p>
<p>Two or four years in the military?  Well, I think we did contribute to SS but if I remember accurately the percentage was lower in those days, and regardless of the program 12% of $100/ month didn't amount to much.    </p>
<p>Still it would be true that whatever he was able to invest in either program would have grown faster at 7% than in the SS program; though adjusting for the ravages of inflation the true return would be more like a post-inflation 3%.</p>
<p>But! he'd not have anything to invest as he'd have been using what little he had to help his aging parents who'd not have SS under your scheme.  The point being that there is no corpus to invest and from which to expect an investment return.  </p>
<p>Also, there is a disability function of SS and some underage kids receive money before they've joined the workforce while others receive it when they can no longer do their jobs.  </p>
<p>Lastly, in the years since Moynihan and a few others joined together in a non-partisan spirit to adjust SS to create a temporary surplus enabling the boomers to retire w/o breaking the bank, I too would rather those several trillion were invested in a productive manner as is our Alaska Permanent Fund, but! alas we've been on an irresponsible spendathon that has made us a nation of debtors rather than savers and are (very quietly) lending our SS surplus to the operating budget of our nation at a very low rate of return.  I suppose we could lend it out at market rates, but then would have to turn around and borrow the couple trillion at market rates as well. </p>
<p>Geez! just think of all the things we "could" do were we not paying interest on the $10-$12 trillion of debt! </p>

<p>Thomas, while you're counting YOUR taxes multiple time (when they're paid TO the next guy those are his income taxes) but perhaps there's a good point and something to consider:</p>
<p>"Besides, isn't each dollar taxed ad infinitum? It's taxed when it's paid to me in salary, when I save it, then again when I spend it, then when that business uses it to buy more inputs, like paying a laborer, when that laborer saves or buys goods..."</p>
<p>........ When we pay a plumber or mechanic $100/hr it seems "too expensive" though they are unlikely to get home with half that much with taxes being a good chunk of the difference. Unlike business, for the most part we can not individually deduct the $100 while a business can and profitable concerns are  paying $67 or less for the same service after taxes. </p>
<p>..... In some sense I suppose "all is well" however the high transaction costs tend to make us a nation of do it yourself plumbers etc. thus much of our work is done, most likely, inefficiently by amateurs.  </p>
<p>...... an improvement, especially in these times?  Shift some of the income tax onto taxes on non-renewable resources with the "two birds" being an improvement in efficiency as regular folk find it easier to employ tradesmen, and, of course, an incentive to waste fewer non-renewables.  </p>

<p>H, You know what I find amusing about Atheists, beyond their crime of Impiety (which may be the underlying root cause of the problem in question), is that their one and only proof results in the reverse of what they have set out to prove. In Advanced Logic, specfically the Predicate and Sentential Calculii this is known as a Reverse Proof and they aren't even sharp enough to figure it out. Which in my mind clearly calls into question their Rationalism. </p>
<p>As for Science itself, the details and techniques of the Scientific Method work only on phenomena on the Physical Plane, but fail miserably as a rational technique when applied to phenomena on the Transcendent Plane. Any good scientist understands this and limits the use of the Scientific Method to those phenomena at the physical level. This is basic science. And so much for R.D's take on the issue.    </p>

<p>I found Sascha O. Becker and Ludger Woessmann argued quite convincingly in their paper "Was Weber Right? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economic History" that protestantism does correlate with economic growth, but only because Martin Luther emphasized literacy (so that one could understand the bible for oneself, rather than relying on a priest). Using data from 19th century Prussia, namely an 1871 census, they did a regression, and found that while protestantism was a good predictor of development (represented using both an income-proxy and an estimated sectoral structure).</p>
<p>Greg Clark also discusses "values" relationship to development in his book "A Farewell to Alms" (which I found decidedly less convincing). He argues that there is a "capitalist" gene, which encourages accumulation and frugality, and institutions in certain countries effectively naturally selected for it. The argument is complex, unusual, and to be honest a bit beyond my abilities to completely understand or explain, but well researched, and definitely worthwhile for anyone interested in Weber and Brooks.</p>

<p>Neil, I wonder if you divide your atheists into two categories?  One would be those who claim to have proof of their position be it "reverse" or other.  This group we would put into a room with those who claim to have a proof of the existence of god or gods and serve them mediocre food and cheap wine.</p>
<p>The other atheists would be those who choose their belief much as do those believing that a god exists; their feelings or blind faith.  For their humility and uncertainty we'd treat them better than the first group.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with your reverse proof.  But if we came upon a box and opened it and using all of our senses along with state of the art science and found nothing in the box, we'd still be a bit shy of proving it empty, shrug our shoulders and head for the lounge named for a famous agnostic.   </p>
<p>But! surely if some of our observers were to claim that something WAS surely in the box but was just beyond our powers of perception it would seem they'd have the heaviest burden of proof as compared to those reporting that they saw nothing and had little reason to believe anything was in the box.  Somewhat curiously this latter group is the most numerous so they'll have to be given hospitality as well. </p>
<p>Then are are those who are not only smack sure THEIR god exists but know exactly what He or She is thinking, will rant about it for hours, but put up no resistance to even the most irrational of wars and social injustices.  They too appear to be well-fed though one surely wonders why.  </p>

<div id="c095545">
<p>Jack, The "proof" is really quite simple. You see, that in order to negate the existence, one must first posit an existence before one can negate it. Hence there is existence. Or if one posits a negated existence then negates it, one comes up with a double negation which is a positive. Hence there is an existence. Then there is the case where one starts with a negation and then tries to prove the negation as a positve (but it's impossible to prove a negative). That's logic. </p>
<p>As for the analogy used, you're trying to stuff the transcendent into a physical box and then analyze it using assorted psychological tools. The Transcendent cannot be forced into various physical categories such as time, space, quantity, quality, etc.; that is why it is transcendent. But Kant covers this in detail in his epistemology.</p>
<p>As for the categories you have created, Athiest, Agnostic, Believers, the breakdown is as follows: </p>
<p>Atheist: no existence<br/>
Agnostic: Maybe no existence, Maybe existence (I'm so confused because I'm trying to hold onto a contradiction)<br/>
Believer: Existence</p>
<p>All of this points to something beyond existence premissis and logic. Which is, "free will" which is part and parcel of the mystery.    </p>

<p>Neil thanks for the explanation, however it strikes me as the double talk of philosophers too long in the Sun or having fallen off the head of a pin.  </p>
<p>Being of the lazy and practical sort I don't take the bait of positing anything.  As for stuffing or otherwise dealing with the transcendent, once I've latched onto that balloon I've left the land of proofs and can only drift with the winds of that which I choose to "believe in" ..unconfirmed miracles,  free will and all.  </p>

<p>Having majored in economics, I have great sympathy for Posner's counter to Brook's argument.  That said, my post graduate school experience has led me to the conclusion that actual humans are no where near as rational as the homo economicus you read about in textbooks.  </p>
<p>While I do not claim to take a definitive position in the debate, even the most educated of us will make suboptimal and irrational choices under the wrong conditions, and marketers are increasingly adept at generating those conditions.  Even without active and somewhat malign action by marketers, it is now well known that we as a species are very bad at dealing with low probability events and intertemporal discounting.</p>
<p>To take the latter first, and in brief, take rebate coupons.  It's been shown in the literature that rebates do affect the decisions people make to purchase products, and yet a large number of buyers swayed by the rebate never mail in the coupon.  The reason seems to be that we underestimate the hassle of filling out and mailing in the coupon, so we don't.  While there's nothing wrong with that, if we were truly rational, we would simply ignore the rebate entirely as having no value to us.  That's not how our minds work.  It seems that we tend to discount the future more than discounted utility theory would have us do.</p>
<p>As for probabilities, the problem has always confused me.  In certain instances, people vastly overstate the likelihood of a low probability event (such as someone who is afraid to fly on commercial airliners, who'd nonetheless not afraid to drive in a car) and yet there are instances where people greatly underestimate the true likelihood of events occurring.  From the literature, it seems the former is more common than the latter, but I've seen both in the real world.</p>
<p>As such, I am not convinced that the greatly increased levels of household debt are in fact a sign of rational decision making in the face of a more varied and sophisticated array of credit options.</p>
