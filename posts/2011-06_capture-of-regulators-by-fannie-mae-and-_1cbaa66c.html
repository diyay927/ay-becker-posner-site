<p> Political economists describe the process whereby government officials end up being the servants rather than the masters of the firms they are regulating as the “capture” by the industry of their regulators. When regulators are captured, much of what they do is motivated, consciously or not, by a desire to help the companies they are regulating, even when the social goals that the regulators should pursue are very different.</p>
<p> A famous illustration of capture is given by the way airlines were regulated under the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) from 1940 to 1978. Large airlines of those times, like American and Delta, naturally had a strong incentive to try to keep new airlines from entering the industry. As a compliant ally of the airline industry, the CAB did not approve one new interstate airline during this almost 40-year period. Many airlines entered the industry when President Carter abolished the CAB, and some of the old standbys, such as Pan Am and Eastern, ceased operations because they could not adjust to a competitive environment.</p>
<p> An economically disastrous example of the capture theory is provided by the disgraceful regulation of the two mortgages housing behemoths, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, before and leading up to the financial crisis. In their fascinating recent book, Reckless Endangerment, Gretchen Morgenson and Joshua Rosner explore in great detail how Fannie Mae used political connections and intimidation of anyone who stood in their way to gain a highly dominant position in the residential mortgage market. The authors’ show that various government officials, including congressmen and presidential cabinet members, closed their eyes to what these two government-supported enterprises (GSE) were doing. They allowed them to take on enormous risks, while publicly defending their behavior as not being highly risky.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Fannie Mae was created in 1938 as a government enterprise that purchased mortgages from banks that loaned money to homebuyers. It eventually became a private investment company regulated by the government, where investors expected that the government would help out if these companies got into trouble. By the beginning of the crisis in 2008, Fannie and Freddie held or guaranteed about half of the United States’ $12 trillion of assets in the residential mortgage market. In September 2008, both Fannie and Freddie were taken over by the federal government when they became insolvent. The loss to taxpayers is likely to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars because many of the mortgages are subprime and of little value.</p>
<p> Reckless Endangerment shows how the chief executive officers of Fannie Mae furthered the reach and reduced the regulatory control over their company by assiduously courting congressmen, Fed officials, the Congressional Budget Office, high-level officials of the U.S. Treasury, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and major economists. The prominent and well informed congressman, Barney Frank, gets especially sharp criticism for his continual support of Fannie and Freddie while he was initially a member, and later chairman, of the House Financial Services Committee, the powerful committee charged with oversight of the housing and financial sectors. Barney Frank remained an unwavering supporter of Fannie and Freddie until 2010, when he admitted that they should have been more closely regulated. In a bit of irony, he is a principal author of the 2010 Dodd-Frank act that attempts to reform the financial sector mainly by giving even greater discretion to the regulators.</p>
<p> Fannie and Freddie had so much money and political power at their disposal that it became risky for anyone to oppose what they wanted: large increases in their holdings of subprime and other mortgages, with no questions asked. Different government agencies that were supposed to either regulate or oversee these GSEs ended up as advocates instead. Well-known economists wrote favorable articles downplaying the riskiness of the holdings of Fannie and Freddie. These articles were sometimes published in journals or other publications sponsored by these companies.</p>
<p> A few government officials were brave enough to risk the wrath of Fannie and Freddie. The authors give particular praise to June O’Neill (I am proud to say she is a former student of mine), who was then head of the Congressional Budget Office. A member of her staff wrote a report that was critical of the degree of risk to taxpayers from the assets held by Fannie and Freddie. These companies tried to get June to suppress the report- she refused- and then a few members of the House of Representatives in cahoots with Fannie and Freddie subjected her to vicious attacks when she steadfastly defended the report in testimony before Congress.</p>
<p> The Fed also comes in for sharp criticism by the authors. One example discussed was a Boston Fed publication in October 1992 claiming that minorities were widely discriminated against in gaining access to mortgage credit. The media, many regulators, and some economists widely praised this study as offering definitive evidence of extensive discrimination against minorities in the credit market. Fannie Mae’s head, the politically astute James A. Johnson, seized on this reaction to promote a large increase in mortgages to poor residents of African-American and Hispanic communities with bad credit histories.</p>
<p> Since I had written a book on discrimination against minorities in the economy, I was curious to see how the authors reached such definite conclusions about mortgage discrimination. I became convinced after reading their study that it was deeply flawed, and failed to show what they claimed about discrimination in the market for mortgages. The theory of discrimination against minorities implies that minority applicants for mortgages would need to have better credit records and higher employment stability than comparable whites in order to obtain mortgages. This suggests that default rates would be lower and profitability higher on loans to minorities.</p>
<p> The study’s authors presented no evidence to support these implications of discrimination theory. All the circumstantial evidence, and some real evidence, showed just the opposite. I published my criticisms in a column for Business Week in 1993 (reprinted on pp. 119-120 in The Economics of Life, a collection of my Business Week articles). The Boston Fed and their supporters tried defending this article against my attack and those by others, but their arguments were weak. Nevertheless, the view persisted that the Fed had “proved” widespread discrimination in the credit market against minorities, and this helped justify an expansion of mortgage loans to families with low incomes and poor employment records.</p>
<p> The Fannie and Freddie story does not demonstrate that government officials, congressmen, economists, and others who sang their praises were corrupt, although undoubtedly some were. But rather that powerful companies and industries can bring massive resources to bear in promoting their interests through lobbying, congressional testimony, financial support to help political candidates win elections, attacks on critics, hiring experts to promote their views, and in many other ways. The result is, as Simon Newcomb, an outstanding American economist and astronomer of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, said a long time ago, “one cent per year out of each inhabitant would make an annual income of $500,000. By expending a fraction of {their} profit, the proposers of policy A could make the country respond with appeals in their favor…Thus year after year every man in public life would hear what would seem to be the unanimous voice of public opinion on the side opposed to the public interests” (p. 459 of his 1885 Principles of Political Economy).</p>
<p> I am not claiming that the reckless behavior of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was solely, or even mainly, responsible for the financial crisis. Enormous blame must go to the commercial and investment bankers who took on vastly excessive risks that endangered their companies and the economy. Nevertheless, that officials charged with overseeing Fannie and Freddie protected the interests of the companies instead of the interests of taxpayers and the general public does not only offer resounding support for the capture theory. For this capture of regulators also inflicted great harm on taxpayers, the American and world economies, and many of the families who exposed their life savings to undue risks in the mortgage market.</p>
