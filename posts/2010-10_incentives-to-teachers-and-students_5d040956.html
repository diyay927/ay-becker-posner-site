<p class="MsoNormal">The traditional public school system had a very weak
incentive structure. Since students automatically went to neighborhood schools,
schools did not have to compete for students. The teachers unions long ago
eliminated merit pay, and made
teachers’ pay determined almost entirely by degrees and years spent teaching.
Finally, in this traditional system, students had little incentive to work
hard, especially when they did not expect to get much education, and could
count on always getting promoted.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All this is beginning to change for the better, despite
fierce opposition from teachers unions to virtually every important reform.
School vouchers, and especially the charter school movement, is bringing
competition to the traditional neighborhood school. No longer can public
schools automatically have a captive audience of all the school age children in
their neighborhood. Charter schools are expanding as rapidly as allowed by
local and state restrictions that have been due mainly to lobbying of
teachers unions. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fortunately, restrictions on charter schools, and the even
greater limits imposed on the scope of school vouchers, are breaking down, in
large part because parents are becoming vocal, and are also voting with the
feet of their children. In addition, careful evaluations of charter schools in
randomized experiments that compare the performance on standardized tests of
students in charter schools to performance by students in regular public
schools generally show that charter school students do significantly better
(see, for example, studies by Josh Angrist of MIT and co-authors of charter
schools in and near Boston).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some progress has also been made in finding ways to better
motivate students, even in traditional public schools. A large and mainly well
designed experiment of poor rural children in Mexico that began in the 1990s,
originally called Progresa (now called Oportunidades), showed that even young
children from uneducated families could be better motivated by financial
incentives. Progresa gave monthly stipends to mothers of children in the program
if they attended school regularly and did decently. School attendance
did rise for families participating in this program, and students stayed in
school longer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Experiments are now ongoing in American public schools by my
colleagues Steve Levitt and John List, along with Roland Fryer of Harvard, on
motivating students by giving financial rewards directly to students rather
than to parents. Although the studies are not yet completed, I would anticipate
that students, especially older students, could be well motivated by monetary
and other rewards for good performance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not surprisingly, teachers unions fight hardest against
reforms that change the way teachers are paid, especially when they introduce
incentives for teachers to perform more effectively. Teachers’ pay should tend
to depend on education and experience, but it should also be sensitive to their
revealed effectiveness as teachers. Teachers unions have for many decades
fought merit pay that allows principals and other administrators to determine “merit” by
their evaluations of how well teachers perform. The unions have claimed that
this approach to merit would give higher pay not to teachers who do the best
teaching, but to teachers who ingratiate themselves into the good graces of the
administrators. Perhaps that argument has some merit in the traditional school
system where administrators of neighborhood schools have some monopoly power,
but it is far less compelling as administrators of public schools increasingly
have to compete for students by offering better education.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In any case, the call now is for merit pay based on more
objective criteria, such as students’ performance on standardized tests. Since
students differ greatly in how well prepared they are for particular classes
and subject matter, it is crucial to design a merit pay system that ties pay
not to the absolute level of performance, but to the increment in performance
added by different teachers. It may also be desirable to try to reduce
“teaching to the test”, whereby teachers only emphasize materials that are
included in the tests used to determine merit pay, although teaching to the
test is valuable if doing well on the “test” requires knowledge of the
important principles. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I do not want to minimize the difficulty of getting a well-designed
system of merit pay, and Posner discusses many such difficulties. However, my
colleague, Derek Neal, has proposed an attractive system of merit pay, where
student performance at the end of the year is compared to that of students who
perform about as well at the beginning of the year. Essentially, teachers then
get a bonus that depends on the percentile ranking of their students at
year-end compared with the performance of the comparable students. Other
education specialists have different ways to determine merit pay that may be
worth considering. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The disgraceful reaction of the LA teachers union to
publication by the LA Times of the database that gives performance scores of
the students of 6000 elementary school teachers is indicative of how teachers unions
feel toward rewarding better teachers. The support by Arne Duncan, the US
Secretary of Education, of the newspaper’s publication of this information is
highly commendable. Not only should such information be published and
publicized, but they should also be used to design a system where merit plays a
sizable part in the monetary compensation of teachers.</p>
