<p class="MsoNormal">During the past couple of years, the financial crisis
induced the US, Europe, Japan, and many other countries to greatly increase
their fiscal deficits and government debt. Unlike the UK and Germany, and a few
other countries, The Obama administration has done little to attack the fiscal
deficit that has grown much larger since his election as president. The absence
of action on the deficit front has been reported to be an important reason why
Peter Orszag recently announced his resignation of Director of the Office of
Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yet despite the seriousness of the rapid increase in
government spending and fiscal deficits during the crisis, the main budgetary
issue facing all developed countries during the next couple of decades is the
expected growth in spending on entitlements: mainly, spending on retirement
incomes, and medical care given to the elderly. The growth in these
expenditures is partly due to growing life expectancy and relatively low birth
rates that will raise the number of retirees collecting social security
benefits while reducing the relative number of men and women who are working to
pay for these benefits. The growth in medical entitlements is mainly the result
of technological advances and other changes that has led to a sharp expansion
in both private and public spending on medical care during the past several
decades, an expansion that is expected to continue into the future.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Orszag, when head of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
in August 2008, predicted that unless radical actions are taken, the cost of
Medicare, Medicaid, and social security will rise from 18 percent of GDP in
2008 to 28 percent by the middle of this century, and perhaps to 35 percent
soon thereafter. Of course, such estimates depend on many guesses, such as the
future rates of growth of GDP, how life expectancy will change, and how many
expensive advances will occur in medical care. Still, these estimates are
consistent with those made by others, and clearly indicate that health and
retirement entitlements will become a growing American fiscal problem unless
important steps are taken to scale them back. Similar concerns apply to the UK,
Germany, Japan, and other rich countries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have supported changing retirement systems from
pay-as-you-go to individual account defined contribution systems, as in
American IRA and Sep private retirement accounts. I also support sharply
increasing the fraction of all medical care spending on the elderly that comes
from out of pocket spending by patients (see my post on March 28). Another
reform could also greatly reduce future public spending on retirement incomes
and health benefits, and make an important contribution to closing the long run
fiscal deficit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This reform involves a big increase in the average age of
retirement before individuals become eligible to qualify for either social
security or old age public healthcare benefits. When the American social
security system was established in 1935, the expected retirement age was 65. At
that time, the average life expectancy for 65 year olds was a mere 12 years.
Therefore, years in retirement amounted on average to about one quarter of the
47 years that men typically worked in the 1920s (before the Great Depression)
prior to reaching age 65. Expected life expectancy of men aged 65 now averages about 18 years,
and it is a few years longer for women.<span> 
</span>Men who retire at age 65 have typically worked on the average about 45
years, so retirement years for these men is about 40% of working years. Actual retirement of many men and women actually occurs at age
62, despite the decline in physically demanding work, and the 
improvements in
health. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I propose that the US and other countries greatly raise over time
the retirement age before the average person became eligible for either social
security retirement income or publicly-funded health benefits. One simple and attractive rule would be to raise retirement age by an amount that
makes the<strong> ratio</strong> of years spent in
retirement to years spent working equal to the ratio that existed at the
beginning of the social security system. Suppose the average person starts
working at age 20, and lives a further 18 years if they make it to age 65. Then
the average number of years spent in retirement for these persons would equal
about one quarter of their average working years, the ratio prior to the
introduction of American social security, if average retirement ages were
raised to age 69 or 70.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the average retirement age were raised to near 70 to
qualify for retirement and elderly health benefits, retirees would still have
more absolute years of retirement than they did 90 years ago. Moreover, their
retirement years would be better because they would be healthier, both
physically and mentally. As at present, men and women in poor health would be
able to retire earlier through the disability system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The US has been slowly increasing the normal retirement age in
stages first from age 65 to 66, and then to age 67 for everyone born after
1960. These have been steps in the right direction, but they do not go far
enough and have been too slow. It is time to raise more rapidly the normal retirement age for persons in
reasonably good health to age 70 before they become eligible for either social
security or Medicare benefits. This would add three years to taxable earnings,
and eventually reduce the number of elderly collecting social security benefits
by almost 20 % compared to what it would be under present retirement ages. It
would also significantly reduce spending on Medicare, although by less than 20%
since persons over age 75 take the bulk of this spending because they are in
worse health than younger retirees. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Maintaining the ratio of working to retirement years is a
reasonable first approximation to a guideline for determining the eligible age
for retirement and health benefits. As the health and life expectancy of the
elderly continues to improve in the future-as they surely will- retirement ages
should be raised beyond age 70. </p>
