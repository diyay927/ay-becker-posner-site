<h3>Response on Affirmative Action-BECKER</h3>
<p>What a rich set of comments on an extremely controversial and difficult issue! I will not try to do justice to all of them, but I will make a few responses.</p>
<p>I argued that affirmative action is less costly to society than many other special interest programs. So I do not understand the criticism of me on this issue.</p>
<p>I agree that most of the diversity arguments about affirmative action are worth little. Diversity arguments were used in the past by Ivy League universities to keep down the number of Jews, and are now used to keep down the number of Asian Americans. A diligent student can learn from any good teacher, no matter his or her background. For example, Jewish students are better off with excellent non-Jewish teachers, sometimes even if they are anti-Jewish, than with mediocre Jewish ones. I believe the same conclusion applies to others.</p>
<p>I believe a major difficulty is in distinguishing affirmative action from anti-discrimination behavior. Otherwise, in the absence of legislation requiring quotas or something similar, I would allow competition to determine the employment and admission policies by firms and schools. </p>
<p>If the top 10% of each school were comparable, students from the lower quality schools would perform as well at universities as students at good schools. But they do not.</p>
<p>I agree that it would be valuable to have more data on performance both in and after schooling of students from various groups. But I am certain I am right that the bad performance of affirmative action students in law schools is not special to law schools. It is pervasive on all campuses in most departments and professional schools.</p>
<p>I agree with the references to Tom Sowell's excellent work on affirmative action around the world. He shows the many pernicious effects not only in the West but also in many other cultures. My argument about the harmful effects of using affirmative action to affect the quality of colleges attended by minority students of different abilities was one I first saw in an early article by Sowell.</p>
<p>I do agree that affirmative action can discourage working hard. Advancement should not be made too easy or too hard. If it is too easy, beneficiaries tend to loaf; if it is too hard, sometimes they give up- see Glenn Louryâs work on some of this.</p>
<p>I have no problem with looking harder for qualified applicants who might be overlooked, even if one can call this a very weak form of affirmative action. But surely it is radically different than advancing persons without sufficient qualifications. </p>
<p>I indicated that perhaps legacies were overused, but I gave a rationale why they could be consistent up to a point with improving the long run quality of a university. , I would not blame a university for using affirmative action if it received larger foundation or government grants when they used affirmative action toward say African-American students. I would, however, blame the foundation, private or public, for using this criterion. I should add that I also oppose affirmative action for students from rural areas, etc. Nothing I said on affirmative action should be construed as applying only to groups defined by race gender, ethnicity, etc.</p>
<p>I do not believe it is correct that Europe does not use affirmative action. For example, I believe Norway requires a minimal fraction of cabinet members to be women, and there are many other examples of affirmative action in Great Britain and other European nations.</p>
<p>I was not complacent about the disadvantages that many minority students suffer from. That is why I support head start programs and the like. But I do believe it is a mistake to confuse even expensive programs that try to bring various minority and other groups up to satisfactory levels with using lower standards to evaluate them.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that in situations without market-clearing prices, as in some admission policies, there would be excess demand or supply that is an invitation to discrimination, segregation, and other bad things. That is one of the advantages of the price system that is seldom fully appreciated. For a discussion of some aspects of this issue with regard to schools and neighborhoods, see my book with Kevin Murphy, Social Economics.</p>
<p>Corey takes it on the chin a lot, and I disagree with much of what he says. But I am very happy that he is an active participant in the discussions. I like having my views challenged (as well as defended!). So Corey, keep being involved! The same goes for Palooka and others. Posner and I intentionally take controversial subjects where there is considerable disagreement, so we expect disagreement. I hope the discussion stays tough but remains for the most part well-mannered.</p>

<p>Really Professor Becker, you should learn the difference between "sex" and "gender".</p>

<p>"Sex" is the proper word to distinguish between males and females.  "Gender" is a word that has been imported from grammar, which doesn't distinguish properly between the sexes, because there are other types of gender (such as neuter).</p>
<p>However, modern PC forces were unhappy with the implications of the word "sex" and its biological ties, so tried to force a new meaning on the word "gender."  They seem to be succeeding, if Chicago Student is any indication, but I'd hardly say the fight for usage is over.</p>

<div id="c064430">
<p>Remember this quote, "People have sex, nouns have gender."</p>
<p>Prof. Becker is using "gender" when he means "sex", not the other way around.</p>
<p>Back to the subject (hopefully Becker will do a quick Google search and see the light on gender) I have a good friend who is an engineering professor at a very good university.  He hates affirmative action because of the effect on individual students, specifically the African-Americans.</p>
<p>If they're there on their own merits, they are dismissed as being affirmative-action admits.  </p>
<p>If they are affirmative-action admits, they are buried under work for which they are unprepared.  Some staggering number of African-Americans in his department were on academic probation, something like 60% in any given term.   </p>

<p>I concede the point that some European countries (sweden, UK, Belgium) do have affirmative action for women when it comes to political representation (at least x% of the people on the ballots should be female). For some jobs and in some countries there is what is called 'positive action' for disabled people: 'all other factors being equal' ('ceteris paribus') the person with the physical handycap should be hired for the job. Finally, in some multi-ethnic cities the police force tries to hire members from specific immigrant groups. In Northern-Ireland they hire both protestans and catholics.</p>
<p>In my comment I only wanted to stress that AA for racial groups is, until now, not practiced in European nations, for a whole raft of historical reasons which we shall leave for future discussions. There is one directive of the European Union that asks to inscribe 'equal treatment / non-discrimination' in the national laws of the member states, that states that a person should not be refused to rent a house or to get a job based on his race or religion, again 'ceteris paribus'.</p>
<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action#Other_nations </p>
<p>It does surprise me that both Posner and Becker are willing to add water to their wine when it comes to AA. I have the impression that abolishing AA would force government to construct measures that try to level the playing field at a younger age (universal education and healthcare) in order to assure meritocracy at a later age. Apparently this early-age intervention is unacceptable for conservative commentators, because it implies the supply of educational and health services which the private sector currently does not. Therefor they defend the notion of restricted AA, while that remains a measure that comes way too late in a person's professional life.</p>

<p>Norway does not require a certain percentage of cabinet members to be women. It has been common practise for the past to decades that at least 40 per cent of the cabinet are women, but this is not regulated by law.</p>
<p>However, a couple of years ago our parliament decided that the board of all public limited corporations shall have 40 per cent of each sex. This law has not come into full force as yet, but it is waiting.</p>

<p>Intersting and very touchy topic.I'm going to give some med school perspective.First,I speak as someone <br/>
whose MCAT's were stratospheric and whose performance in med school was mediocre.The tests probably give a good first approximation of ability,but not of discipline,work habits,care for patients feelings-all the things that are part of being a dr.However,as important as all these are,there is a certain intellectual level thatis necessary  to do the work.And it is silly to think intangibles  are in inverse ratio  to measurable  factors.<br/>
  Now, a little admission data.Please be advised it's 25 years (almost) since I had anything to do <br/>
with admissions.Our program added MCAT and GPA  to <br/>
list highest to lowest  among entering students on <br/>
a numerical scale.Our lowest entering student (and I pulled up old files ) had a 2.16 MCAT anda 2.21 GPA.(WE  did have an entering student with a slightly lower MCAT,but a higher GPA.This  was  not someone who  had a snowball's chance of doing professional school work.It  wasn't someone who could have received a Bachelor's in a science -based major.And it was someone who failed his/her first year.(I don't know what happened after that.)</p>
<p> I don't know the answer to this .I do know I resisted reading the Murray/Herrnstein "opus",partly because I was afraid of what I might<br/>
read. But I feel time is running out on the taboo of talking frankly about affirmative  action and ethnic differences .</p>

<div id="c064579">
<p>This discussion on AA is likely to go nowhere because it focus only on admissions, as if the process of going through college or graduate school depends exclusively on innate individual ability or traits.</p>
<p>In the most competitive educational programs it makes a big difference whether or not a student has either a network of acquantainces or a mentor who already went through that experience successfully.</p>
<p>I explain.</p>
<p>If we focus on grades, there are tricks that newcomers into the system do not know. Examples are getting past exam collections and professors' research papers. Even if a newcomer catches up, it is more costly to get them in money and time.</p>
<p>If we focus now on the job prospects, there are traits like social networking skills, knowing how to sell oneself and fraternize with superiors, that are even more relevant than grades. Particularly in those programs where grade inflation is present i.e. grades become a non-informative signal. Like in a university whose name begins with 'H'. There are many others.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that in the upper echelons of academia the game is not only of intellectual competition but also of political competition for power and funding. It hardly resembles a free competitive market.</p>
<p>Unsophisticated individuals are simply not aware the importance of politics and of maintaining a certain image, not to mention they do not have it to begin with. </p>
<p>Again, when (if) they catch up, it's too late already, you only have one chance to impress your professors. They already made up their mind about you.</p>
<p>Many times minorities are either too shy or not used to deal with different people. Particularly in academia, where people are usually not 'normal'. For example, they might take personally the aggressions or condescendence of mean professors. There are a great many of them. So it is difficult for them to get into the 'club' without an introducing member's help and guidance.</p>
<p>What minorities, poor whites or any newcomer into the educational system need is not a free admission pass or lower standards but a substitute support network.</p>
<p>Many times, outstanding minorities are where they are now thanks to their abilities AND high profile sympathetic mentors. Thomas Sowell would be the textbook case.<br/>

<p>Hi all. Learn the art of patience. Apply discipline to your thoughts when they become anxious over the outcome of a goal. Impatience breeds anxiety, fear, discouragement and failure. Patience creates confidence, decisiveness, and a rational outlook, which eventually leads to success.<br/>
