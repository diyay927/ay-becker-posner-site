			In a recent post (see my discussion on July 28) I explained why the American health delivery system is superior in some important dimensions to health care in most other advanced countries. Americans have considerably longer life expectancies when they contract serious diseases, like cancers and heart conditions, than do persons living in these other nations. That post emphasized that many criticisms of the American system do not sufficiently appreciate its positive effects on both the quantity and quality of life.

Here I address a few of its major shortcomings, and suggests ways to overcome, or at least moderate, these without eroding the strong parts of the system. I recommend to readers the many high quality discussions of health care reform by John Goodman of the think tank, The National Center for Policy Analysis, and also a good op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal of August 12th by John Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods. 

A glaring weakness of the American health system is the over 40 million Americans without health insurance.  To be sure, they impose much less of a cost on the health care system than is commonly claimed, partly because the majority of the uninsured are young and healthy. Still, in a country as wealthy as the US, this is embarrassing, and should be rectified. 
The least bad solution, strangely, opposed by many conservatives, is to require everyone to take out catastrophic health insurance that covers each person against major illnesses. Those individuals and families that lack the means to pay for such insurance would be supported under a version of Medicaid. Such compulsory insurance for everyone would greatly reduce the uninsured problem, in particular their free riding on others when they get seriously sick and go to hospitals for extensive care. Increasing their medical coverage in this way would add to total spending on medical care, but it might well reduce the cost of medical spending to others. Since the uninsured would be forced to take out such insurance, they would pay for any major medical care through insurance premiums rather than imposing the cost of their care on taxpayers and other groups who pay for their hospital care.
Another feature of the present system is that most Americans receive their health insurance through employment. Americans are stuck for political reasons with this system for a while, yet a few important changes may be politically feasible to significantly reduce its cost, inequities, and inflexibilities. To start, a cap should be placed on the amount of employment-based health insurance that is tax-deductible, so that employees would have to pay for so-called "Cadillac" plans out of their own incomes rather than out of taxpayers' incomes. A second reform would be to provide the tax savings from these plans in the form of tax credits rather than tax deductions, so that higher income employees would not have a tax advantage to opt for expensive plans only because taxpayers foot much of the bill. 
A third and very important reform of the employment -based health insurance system would be to make the same tax savings available to persons who buy health insurance outside of their jobs. One advantage of encouraging the purchase of non-employment-based health insurance is that persons changing jobs would not risk losing their health insurance. This would also raise the attractiveness of working at small companies that find it too expensive to provide health insurance. This extension would increase the taxpayer burden from health insurance, but that burden would be offset by the elimination of the tax deductibility of Cadillac plans.
Perhaps the greatest problem facing the health care system is the high and rapidly growing cost of Medicare for the elderly as the American population ages, and as new drugs and surgical procedures are developed to treat diseases of old age. I agree with Posner that a means test for Medicare should be implemented, so that older men and women who can pay for their medical care should get a much smaller subsidy. This would reduce the incentive for these persons to opt for expensive drugs and surgeries only because they pay a small share of the cost. I do believe that older persons would still be willing to pay a lot to extend their lives, partly out of their fear of death. But that belief should be put to the test by requiring the elderly who are reasonably well off to spend more of their own money for their medical care.
In order to increase the number of older persons with enough financial means to cover much of their spending on medical care, further encouragement should be given to tax exempt health savings accounts, where unused balances can be carried over to later years. By age 65, families that have made prudent use at younger ages of the monies in these accounts would then have accumulated sizable balances that will prepare them much better financially for the medical risks of old age.
Another way to reduce medical spending by the elderly in the long run is to encourage, not continue to attack, drug and biotech companies, so that they invest more in developing new drugs that treat better the major diseases of old age. The research and development work required to expand significantly the production of new important drugs would add only a very small fraction to the huge total medical spending. Moreover, this cost would be more than offset by the savings from substituting drugs for expensive surgeries or hospital stays, for drugs have the major advantage over these other treatments that they can be used to treat large numbers at relatively small additional cost. The cost structure of drugs- high initial costs and then low costs of extensive use among the population- is especially advantageous to a health care delivery system, like the American one, that has trouble denying available medical care to persons who might benefit only very slightly.
The current Congressional bills on health car reform generally include a public insurance option; that is, a federal government health insurance plan that would compete against private plans. The Obama administration is retreating from its emphasis on the importance of including this option, and the details about the form such an option will take have not been spelled out. Nevertheless, the experiences of other government-run operations strongly indicate that whatever Congress says in these bills, such an option will cause far more harm than good. For one thing, employees of a government-run health plan are likely to be unionized, just as public school teachers and postal workers are unionized. These unions have raised the costs of operating schools and the postal system through their pay structure, and they have reduced the efficiency of these operations through opposition to innovations, merit pay, and other efficiency-raising changes. 
Supporters of a government-run plan claim that it will be financially self-supporting, and will provide a standard for private plans. To see how this would work out in practice, consider the postal system, a nominally private but basically a very old government -run business. The postal system is also supposed to be self-supporting, but only recently it once again asked Congress for additional subsidies to cover deficits. It strains credibility to expect that a large government-run health care option will not run huge deficits. Just as part of the postal deficits are caused by government mandates, such as providing Saturday deliveries at no added cost, so Congress will also impose costly and inefficient mandates on the government health care option, in addition to other inefficiencies of such a government health care organization. 
The micro details of the way the postal system operates are hardly reassuring about the efficiency or flexibility of a public insurance option. To illustrate, we summer in a small town on Cape Cod that has about a 1,000 year-round population that rises to about 10,000 during the heart of the summer. In responding to this large seasonal change, Fed Ex, a non-union private company, rents delivery trucks from auto rental companies to supplement their own fleet of trucks, adds temporary workers, and extends their hours of operation, so that they often make deliveries long after sunset. By contrast, the local post office maintains exactly the same hours as during the off-season. This includes closing for lunch from 12-1, closing at 4:30PM every weekday, and staying open only for a few hours on Saturdays. Since there is no regular mail delivery because the all year round population is too small, many families rent boxes at the post office. Instead of arranging to allow box-holders to access their boxes at most hours even when the postal window is closed, box access is only marginally better than access to the postal window, including no Sunday box access, and only morning Saturday access.
