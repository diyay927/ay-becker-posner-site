			Children in the better secondary schools in Korea, Japan,
China, Turkey, and other countries work very hard not only because of
considerable school homework, but also through their parents spending
considerable sums on private tutoring. In these countries, spending on tutoring
is a sizable fraction of total spending on high school students; indeed, in
Korea, spending on after-class tutoring has been estimated to be almost as large
as spending by public high schools. The aim of the spending by parents on
tutoring is to improve their children’s chances of getting into the top
schools, such as Tokyo and Keio Universities in Japan, and Seoul National
University in Korea.
<p> </p>
<p>With the worldwide boom in higher education and in the
demand by business and governments for college graduates, the Korean and
Japanese emphasis on hard work in secondary school has spread to other nations.
For example, since enrollments in Chinese universities have increased manifold since
1995, the competition to get into the top schools, such as Beijing University,
is fierce, even though the number of Chinese universities has also expanded
rapidly. As a result, many Chinese parents are spending increasing amounts on
the secondary education of their children, including private schooling and
extra tutoring.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although secondary school students work very hard in Japan,
Korea, and many other countries, they tend to relax and take it much easier at
universities. They often need a few years to recover their energies. So even at
the best universities there, homework is not that extensive and much time is
left for play.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The American education system had traditionally followed an
approach that is the opposite of the Japan-Korean approach to education. High
schools, even the better ones, did not give much homework, and relatively
little money was spent on private tutoring. Of course, much learning occurred
in the better high schools, but at a leisurely pace, with considerable time for
athletics, theatre, school newspapers, and other school activities, and also
for parties, watching television programs, listening to music, and other out of
school pursuits. But once at a good university students had to buckle down to
hard work, or at least much harder work than in high school.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This American approach to education is radically
changing at the better public and private high schools because during the past
couple of decades it has become much more difficult to get into the top
colleges and universities. Teachers are giving greater amounts of homework, and
families are also spending a lot more on private tutoring. The tutoring is
partly in math and other subjects, and partly in direct preparation for the SAT
exams that in good measure determine whether students get accepted into the
better colleges and universities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Presumably, parents, high school teachers, and students
perceive that the students gain enough from attending the top colleges to
justify the additional time, money, and energy put into trying to gain
acceptance to these schools. It has long been known that graduates from top
colleges and universities get better jobs and earn more than do graduates from
lesser schools. What has been much less certain is whether these graduates do
better because they are abler, and hence would have done better even if they
had attended lower level schools. Recent econometric studies have more
successfully separated out the performance of colleges from the selection of
students. These studies examine the earnings of students who were rejected from
and accepted into the top American schools when they have comparable SAT
scores, high school grades, and other characteristics.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The studies find that students who attend harder to get
into schools earn considerably more over their lifetimes than comparable
students who attend schools that spend less per student and where average SAT
scores are lower (a good summary is by Caroline Hoxby in “College Choices Have
Consequences”, SIEPR Policy Brief, December, 2012). Most of the difference in
earnings is apparently due not to the amount that schools spend per student,
but to the quality of the other students attending the same schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Earnings of college graduates depend on how much their
schools spent on their education, the various abilities and skills of the
graduates, and the characteristics of the other students at the schools they
attended. Hoxby shows that spending per student has grown much more rapidly
since the 1960s at the top colleges than at lesser colleges, while at the same
time tuition per student at the top schools has grown much more slowly than
spending per student. It is also documented that earnings of college students
per dollar spent on their education has risen substantially since 1980. As a
result, the economic gains to graduates from the top schools have risen greatly
during the past 40 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These three facts, that returns to college education have
risen rapidly during the past several decades, that spending per student at the
top colleges has also increased rapidly, and that the cost of attending these
schools has grown much more slowly, can readily explain why students at the
better high schools face a much more rigorous workload than in the past. They also
explain why their parents spend a lot more on private tutoring. The gains from
having better grades, higher SAT scores, and more extracurricular activities
have risen considerably because that helps students get into the top schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>These results do not answer the basic question of whether
the extra effort by high school students is socially productive, or whether it
is partly a social waste (an “arms race”) because efforts by different students
partly just offset each other without producing socially valuable knowledge.
The evidence I have discussed has a mixed message about this. On the one hand,
the fact that the better colleges and universities ration entry rather than by
raising tuition to the more marginal applicants suggests that these students
fight it out for the limited and rationed slots at the top schools by becoming
better “armed” with higher SAT scores and more extracurricular activities. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the other hand, the fact that the quality of other
students at the same university positively affects the subsequent earnings of
all the graduates from that university suggests that too little is spent on
higher scores and better preparation. The reason is that higher scores by any
student improve the subsequent performance of other students at the same
college. A further issue not fully resolved is how much of the benefits from
attending universities like Harvard, Stanford, Chicago, Tokyo, Seoul National,
and Beijing come from the reputation of these schools rather than from the
valuable knowledge and skills (including networks) possessed by graduates from
these schools.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the net result on the “arms race” aspect of the
improved student preparation for college admission is not clear from the
available evidence, the evidence cited explains why students in the better
American high schools are working so much harder than they did several decades
ago. I suspect that the greater earnings and other gains from attending top
universities also applies, perhaps even more strongly, to Japan, Korea, and the
other countries where the better high schools require so much work. </p>
