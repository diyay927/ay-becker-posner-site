<h3>Health Reform and Obesity--Posner</h3>
<p>The biggest problem besetting the Administration's program of health reform is how to pay for it. The heart of the program is extending insurance coverage to tens of millions of people who at present are not insured. This will cost more than $100 billion a year just in subsidies, but the total cost will be higher because demand for medical services will rise. At present, people who are not insured are billed directly for medical services. Often they cannot pay, but then their credit takes a hit, or they are forced into bankruptcy. And emergency rooms use queuing to increase the cost of their services to the indigent. When the uninsured become insured, the marginal cost of medical services to them falls to the copayment or deductible that they are charged; the total price (pecuniary plus nonpecuniary) is now much lower, so more service is demanded, and prices to all consumers of medical services rise because supply is inelastic.</p>
<p>Some advocates of extending coverage argue that it will reduce aggregate medical costs. They point out that people may defer preventive care that might ward off an illness, or a worsening condition, that might cost more to treat than preventive care would have cost. The other side of this coin is that preventive care may keep alive people who would have died, thus ending their demand for medical care. But everyone dies eventually, and a very high fraction of total medical costs are incurred in the last few months of life. Moreover, because of technological progress and the high value that people place on extending their life, medical expenses are growing far more rapidly than per capita income, and, as a result, postponing death imposes disproportionately greater costs on the next generation. A partial offset, however, may be that greater and therefore more costly efforts may be undertaken to postpone death the younger the dying person is. </p>
<p>Preventive care can also be very costly, especially when it takes the form of expensive screening: screening costs are incurred by the healthy as well as the sick.</p>
<p>The most attractive form of preventive care, at least from a government budgetary standpoint (disregarding for a moment nonpecuniary benefits and costs, to which I'll return), is behavioral change: for example, safe sex as an AIDS preventive--or losing weight, or, more realistically, not gaining excessive weight in the first place, to prevent obesity.</p>
<p>Obesity has increased rapidly in the United States, to the point where, at present, more than half the adult population is overweight and 25 percent is obese. A recent study estimates that the average obese person incurs annual medical expenses that exceed by 42 percent the average annual medical expenses of the non-obese; the aggregate excess cost is almost $150 billion a year. Average expense is potentially misleading because of the shorter lifespan of unhealthy people. However, I believe that except in cases of extreme obesity, the effect on lifespan is less than the effect in creating medically treatable conditions such as diabetes, joint problems, complications from surgery, and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>The economist Tomas Philipson and I have written about the economics of obesity. We have pointed out that the decline in the price of fatty foods, along with the rise in the opportunity cost of physical activity (work is more sedentary than it used to be, so one has to invest extra time to get exercise, and television and video games have increased the utility that people derive from sedentary leisure pursuits), explains the dramatic long-term increase in the percentage of Americans who are seriously overweight.</p>
<p>It might seem that if people derive greater utility from consuming fatty foods in large quantity than the costs in illness and medical care, the increase in obesity actually is optimal from an economic standpoint. But there are three reasons to doubt this. The first is that the obese externalize part and probably most of the excess medical costs that their condition imposes, because health insurers (including Medicare) generally do not discriminate on the basis of weight. The second reason to doubt that we have the optimal amount of obesity is that high and rising aggregate health costs, because financed to a large extent by government, are contributing to the serious fiscal problems of the United States: the United States has a soaring national debt that may have very grave long-term consequences for America's prosperity. Obesity thus has potential macroeconomic significance.</p>
<p>Third, there is reason to doubt that the obese actually gain more utility from the behaviors that contribute to their obesity than the costs of obesity, which are not limited to medical costs but include discomfort, loss of mobility, discrimination by employers, and social ostracism by people who consider obesity repulsive or believe it signals lack of self-control, gluttony, or low IQ (or all three characteristics).</p>
<p>Obesity is highly correlated with education. Highly educated people are much more likely to be thin than people who are not highly educated. This is partly but not only because highly educated people have on average higher incomes than other people. They can afford more expensive foods, which are low in calories, and the cost of exercise, which can be considerable, as it may require joining a gym or having a personal trainer.</p>
<p>But income is not a complete explanation, because highly educated people in low-paying jobs, as many teaching (including college teaching) jobs are, tend to be thin. But is this because one needs education to realize that eating fatty foods makes one fat and that fat people have medical and other problems that thin people do not? Surely not. It is rather that educated people have better impulse control, or, in economic terms, a lower discount rate (the rate at which a future cost or benefit is equated to a present cost or benefit), than uneducated people do, on average at any rate. To get an education means incurring present costs for future benefits, and that is less attractive the higher one's discount rate. Moreover, intelligent people derive greater benefits from education in terms of present enjoyment and future income than unintelligent people do, and intelligence implies lower costs of foreseeing consequences of one's actions: it is easier for an intelligent person to realize the consequences of indulging one's tastes for fatty foods than an unintelligent person, given that obesity is not an immediate consequence of eating such foods. Low-IQ people (and many high-IQ ones as well) may also fail to realize how much more difficult it is to lose weight than to avoid gaining weight in the first place.</p>
<p>A further problem with people of low intelligence and (what goes with it) low income is poor parenting, as a result of which children grow up with bad eating habits, including excessive consumption of fatty goods; these habits may be difficult to break in adulthood.</p>
<p>If the unintelligent experience greater costs of imagining the consequences of eating fatty foods, that is an argument for providing them with greater information about those consequences, to offset their deficit in understanding. Maybe with full knowledge the unintelligent would be willing to incur the costs, in somewhat more expensive food and in fewer sedentary leisure pursuits, of avoiding becoming obese. So aggregate utility might actually be increased, as well as aggregate medical costs reduced, by an effective campaign of warning people about the consequences of eating fatty foods. I do not think that government should regulate behavior on the premise that it knows better what makes people happy than people themselves do; but controlling external costs is or should be an uncontroversial governmental function.</p>
<p>Such an educational campaign as I have suggested would be a cheap form of preventive care, but would it be effective? The evidence is mixed, but a 2008 review article by Lisa Harnack and Simone French in the International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity finds that labeling restaurant menus with calorie information does reduce consumption of high-calorie foods. Conjoined with reduced calories in school lunches, elementary- and high-school courses in nutrition, and warnings in food advertising and labeling similar to the warnings in cigarette advertising and labeling, the prevalence of obesity might be reduced at slight cost--possibly to the benefit of almost everyone except the sellers of fatty foods.</p>
<p>One of the health-care-reform bills pending in the Senate would relax legal limitations on "discrimination" by private group-health insurers; that is a step in the right direction, as are growing efforts by employers to encourage their workers to control weight (the motive is to reduce the cost of health insurance to the employer). Medicare could be modified to reduce fees to thin people. In addition, a calorie-based food tax (which would, for example, fall heavily on sugar-flavored soft drinks), would reduce obesity at negative cost to the public fisc. Such a tax may seem "unfair" to people who consume such foods but are thin, but this is just to say that the tax would be at once a regulatory and a revenue tax, and in the latter aspect would be subject to criticism only if it were an inefficient tax relative to alternative methods of taxation.</p>

<p>Professor Posner</p>
<p>Perhaps excessive usage of carbohydrates is more important factor in obesity than the fat.</p>
<p>I recommend my obese patients to avoid white bread, potato, plain coffeebread, sugar, beverage, pasta etc.</p>
<p>Patients are allowed to use freely vegetables, fruits, skim milk, meat, fish. Dark bread is allowed when not used excessively.</p>

<p>This is among the least-persuasive arguments I have read from Professor Posner. He says that there are three reasons to suspect behaviours which lead to obesity are non-optimal:</p>
<p>1. fiscal externality: government relieves the individual of some of the costs of obesity, separating private and social costs.</p>
<p>2. the government spends more than it earns.</p>
<p>3. obesity has large private costs.</p>
<p>Point 1 is the most plausible. </p>
<p>Points 2 and 3 are, I think, absurd. Quite obviously, the US government's irresponsible fiscal behaviour on unrelated issues has nothing whatsoever to do with the optimality of any individual's eating and exercise decisions. The costs mentioned in point 3 are entirely privately borne and easily anticipated. The mere existence of these costs, even noting they are perhaps large, is useless without a corresponding assessment of benefits.</p>
<p>Point 1 at least makes some sense - but again it is dubious. Browning (1999) makes the case that the correct response to fiscal externality is to remove the externality, rather than regulate what it affects. In this case, asking public insurers to take obesity into account when setting premiums would internalise the problem. </p>
<p>To be honest, I doubt it would make much difference, for two reasons. One, obesity is not a major driver of total health care costs unless one is morbidly obese. Two, I strongly suspect that health care costs are a small fraction of the total costs of obesity, including health care costs but also social stigma, reduced earnings, physical difficulties of movement, and so on. Even if premiums rise 20% due to obesity, I suspect that represents only a small fraction of total costs and, accordingly, a small fraction of total benefits.</p>
<p>The danger in Posner's argument if it is accepted is that there is that a great deal of human enterprise can be regulated or banned outright if fiscal externality, a fiscal deficit, and large private costs are sufficient conditions for public intervention. </p>
<p>Not a well thought-out argument by Professor Posner, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a study comparing the medical costs incurred in the last year of life for different causes of death -- i.e., heart disease versus lung cancer?  I think that sort of study is needed to determine whether increased preventative care will reduce aggregate medical costs: If the preventive costs of a particular disease are lower than the end-of-life costs, increased preventive care would probably reduce aggregate costs after appropriate discounting.  Or the opposite could be true.  Regardless, this sort of comparison would be much more informative than Posner's broad statements that preventative care is expensive and end-of-life medical costs are high.  Both could be true, yet increased preventative care would still reduce aggregate costs.</p>

<p>Haven't studies established that the costs of medical care from age-related health problems are higher than for obesity-related health problems?  </p>
<p>Obesity has risen because (1) tasty, fatty foods have become cheap and plentiful, (2) sedentary jobs are more common, and (3) there are plenty of ways to deal with it.  It's not that the less-intelligent, less-wealthy types gravitate to poor eating habits -- there are scads of educated, elitist obese people as well.  The first group might eat Big Macs while the latter eats creamy sauces and expensive chocolates, but the end result is the same.  </p>

<p>As I understand it, there is no evidence at all that mild success via calorie labeling in getting people to avoid some high-calorie foods at a particular meal translates into lower caloric intake overall and so to reduction in weight, to a significant enough reduction to change an obese person into a non-obese one, and finally to reduction in health-care costs.  Counting on that to yield savings... </p>

<p>Maybe youth sports should be banned because MRI's are too expensive in a socialized healthcare system?  Seriously, let's only allow the Lebron James' of the world to play youth sports and tell everyone else there isn't enough money in the system for you to play.  This will reduce healthcare costs big time.  </p>
<p>Where do you draw the line when it comes to government rationing healthcare?  Maybe allowing Obama to masterplan our lives isn't a good idea?  There is no end to this assault on liberty.</p>
<p>The only thing more disgusting than watching people throw down Big Mac's is watching a society become totally and utterly dependent on a bankrupt government.  It is wreckless and irresponsible for a society to rely on government for everything when it has to print and borrow money at unsustainable rates.  I don't care what your weight is, a KEYNESIAN is more irresponsible than a person who diets on fast food.  A keynesian can have all the college degrees his credit score can leverage, but he still doesn't realize that Marxism doesn't work in the real world.  </p>

<p>Excercise NEVER requires joining a gym or hiring a personal trainer.  Sure, those things can make it easier* to get in shape, but there are an infinate amount of excerise opporunities in which someone can partake outside of the gym.  </p>
<p><br/>
*I think a lot of people that join gyms have a mentality that they can only workout at the gym, and if they don't have time to go they skip working out entirely rather than putting in 10-15 minutes of excerise at or around the home.  The net effect being that it becomes "harder" to workout.  Of course that's just my opinion.  </p>

<p>I very much enjoyed reading this post, especially when differing discount rates were discussed. I think that this very well could be a very important distinction between those who chose to eat unhealthy and become obese, and those who watch their diet and weight. I think it has less to do with IQ or intelligence, however, and more to do with simple personal preferences. If this is true, doesn't it make the argument that instead of imposing some excise tax on sugary, fatty, or high calorie foods-- as Professor Posner suggested here, and discussed in previous posts-- that discriminating costs of health-care based on risky or destructive behaviors would be better?</p>

<p>The obesity problem can be easily explained by a very simmple formula: </p>
<p>(C X P.E.)- 2000 = F.A.</p>
<p>Where:  C=caloric intake<br/>
        P.E.= physical expenditure coefficient<br/>
        2000= constant caloric body mass<br/>
              maintenance coefficient<br/>
        F.A.= fat accumulation</p>
<p>So it becomes quite apparent that if C rises and P.E. stays the same Fat accumulates. If one drops C and increases P.E. Fat does not accumulate or accumulates more slowly over time. For fat people, the desired equation is to create a negative F.A. until the "ideal" body mass index is reached. As for those who are undernourished, create a positve F.A. until the "ideal" Body mass index is reached. Once the "ideal" BMI is reached in both cases, the equation needs to be balanced so that F.A.=0. "Simple" huh?</p>
<p>As for the social phenomena of the "poor" being obese, this is due to the food stuffs that they can afford. Mostly fats and carbohydrates, all high C value materials. So the solution lies in decreasing their P.E. coefficient by working them more in heavy physical labor. It might even help to stimulate the Economy. At least society would get something valuable and decrease the crime rate at the same time.      </p>

<p>I understand the arguments, and find that since I am morbidly obese, I must therefore be unintelligent, poor, and incapable of making decisions.  Will you then further decide that I should die by age 60 (or 50 or 40 whatever age thin people think we should disappear) and take us out of the equation?  You would eliminate medical costs and make lots of space in the job and housing market if we were dead first.</p>

<p>Again, where do you draw the line when RATIONING out government healthcare...?</p>
<p>Should we deter kids from playing youth sports?  Afterall, sports injuries are costly and most kids will never make the NBA or NFL anyway.  For the social good and overall effort of government-masterplanned equality (is this equality...?), should we eliminate youth sports for non-athletic kids or penalize them somehow?</p>
<p>Should the Government continue to fund injuries for those who partake in extreme behavior (say for example:  downhill skiing)?  Why should these people be allowed to exploit our government run healthcare while fat people be penalized?  One knee surgery is probably as costly as a heart attack.</p>
<p>Has anyone even considered equality here?  Some say obesity is a disease that you are born with.  Imagine if we rationed out healthcare but instead penalized a specific race or gender coverage because statistics illustrate they are a greater burden to the healthcare system.  How about gay people and AIDS victims.  They are a burden on the budget too relative to healthy people.  We cannot possibly provide State-healthcare for these people due to costs, but we can send foreign aid to Africa with borrowed money from the Chinese every year so Bono can perform a concert?</p>
<p>We are watching a train wreck unfold.  This is a catastrophe in the making.  Either the Democrats are going to get whipsawed once the American people wake up and realize what is going on, or this country is going down exactly how Rome went down.</p>

<p>Seriously, Posner is more like Hitler than Stalin here.  Maybe we should just euthanize the obese in order to eliminate healthcare cost burdens on the STATE....?  The obese are such a drag on society, let's just rid them of our utopian society.</p>
<p>Guys, this really is crazy.  Posner is rationalizing the RATIONING of government healthcare before Obama and the liberals have even nationalized healthcare.  If this is not a wake up call for rational citizens of this country, then I don't know what is.  It won't stop with the obese, anyone could be next.  The Statist will argue that the government must fund late-term carte blanche abortion, but will penalize people who eat more than they should.  </p>
<p>Do we really want Obama and Nancy Pelosi controlling your life like this?  </p>
<p>This is pure insanity.  Revolution is nearing.  I'm almost certain of that after reading opinions like this from our so called scholars.  They rationalize Hitler's dream based on something they read in a textbook, yet they have zero understanding of the real world we all live and work in.</p>

<p>Mr. Posner,</p>
<p>Ceteris paribus, obesity occurs when one consumes more calories than they exert on a daily basis.  Did it occur to you that your correlation of eduction and obesity is, in fact, a correlation of laziness and obesity?  Education, in this country, is a pursuit against laziness.  It is a pursuit against inertia.  Lazy people do not often pursue education at higher levels.  Please understand that education is not the proper correlation.  Work smarter, not harder!  </p>

<p>Posner claims highly educated people tend to be thin.  What a joke posing as reason.  I was thin when lowly educated and made a living with my hands and aching back.  Many lowly educated people today are thin for the same reason, even if Posner declines to acknowledge their existence.</p>

<p>   Are there studies of the pleasure some people get from medical treatment.  Posner seems to think medical treatment is all misery, which it probably is to most people, myself included.  But lots of people seem to love to talk about all the drugs and therapies they are taking, the specialists they have seen, the operations they have undergone.  I suspect they not only love to talk about it but love the attention they get from the doctors, nurses, therapists, etc.  There are, of course, classic hypochondriacs, but people with genuine illnesses also fit into this category.  The fact that so few people pay much of the cost of their treatments or pay insurance premiums based on their individual histories or risk makes these pleasures all the more attractive.</p>

<p>"The biggest problem besetting the Administration's program of health reform is how to pay for it. The heart of the program is extending insurance coverage to tens of millions of people who at present are not insured. This will cost more than $100 billion a year just in subsidies, but the total cost will be higher because demand for medical services will rise. This will cost more than $100 billion a year just in subsidies, but the total cost will be higher because demand for medical services will rise. At present, people who are not insured are billed directly for medical services. Often they cannot pay, but then their credit takes a hit, or they are forced into bankruptcy."</p>
<p>Except the government already pays at least a substantial portion of those costs once the indigent, uninsured patient goes into bankruptcy, so this statement is at best misleading.  </p>
<p>None of this, of course, addresses the issue that even though the U.S. government already spends three times as much annually per person than the next highest spender (Australia), the real reason other countries adopted UHC is not because it is cost-effective but because they realized that thinking the government had more important things to spend money on than the basic health of its citizens is hard to characterize as anything but sociopathic.</p>

<p>Correction, with apologies: private expenditure per capita in the U.S. is three times the next-highest, which is again Australia.  Even so, U.S. government expenditure on health care is still the highest of any nation in the OECD at around $2880 per person, with the next highest being France with $2714. </p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons we spend so much more on health care than other countries, but I have a very hard time swallowing the argument that obesity is the single tipping point when Europeans smoke so much more than Americans.  If I had to venture a guess as to the economics of it, I would say the biggest factor is that under a universal system, the government's monopoly power coupled with a lack of the profit motive puts it in a unique position to keep drug costs and salaries down, fewer administrative costs, and so forth.  </p>

<p>While tackling the obesity issue is, undoubtedly, a big chunk of preventative care, we're overlooking  two issues that could also cost the health care system untold amounts:  alcohol and tobacco consumption.  I'm not convinced that these two aren't worse than obesity, especially since they usually come in a package deal to begin with.</p>

<p>This is an interesting discussion.  I'd be interested to hear Messrs. Posner's and Becker's views on whether transportation policy also has an effect and what, if anything, should be done.  Last month, for example, in a report on obesity in the US, CDC called for, among other things, enhancing infrastructure that supports "complete streets," including walking (the cheapest exercise) and biking (see http://www.completestreets.org/news/public-health-community-lines-up-behind-complete-streets/ and http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5807a1.htm).</p>
<p>We live in a very car-centric country, with both federal and state governments enabling the bad habit of driving while burdening the right to walk (e.g. by failing to enforce laws protecting pedestrians, by "engineering" streets in ways that making safe walking difficult -- and sometimes impossible).</p>
<p>What say you to this side of the issue? </p>

<p>Posner could have been more prudent with his choice of words (i.e. saying something other than fatty foods). As Pekka NykÃ¤nen said, there is a very reasonable case to be made that the carbohydrates are tied in at the root of most peopleâs excessively high body fat compositions.  My own casual empiricism has suggested that foods that are low fiber, high carbohydrate and high fat (e.g. Pizza) are generally the worst foods to eat in this regard.  </p>
<p>In the end it is not whether the foods are âfattyâ but it is the total calories consumed that we should be concerned aboutâ¦ or is it?  I would challenge Anonymous at August 3, 2009 2:20 PM to explain how people accumulate Lean Body Mass (primarily muscle but also bone and misc. tissues) given the equation presented.  Calories consumed that are not burned ultimately result in the accumulation of body fat or LBM.  That being said, in a sedentary society LBM accumulation is generally a nonstarter. </p>
<p>But, if someone, for reasons of âhungerâ, lack of self control, or gluttony, etc. is going to consistently eat more calories than his/her body burns on a given day (no matter the activity level) and over 10 years add on 20 pounds, if that person did adequate weight training, he or she would have a lower body fat % after 10 years. </p>
<p>Finally, I think Posner is right, the government generally does have an interest in externalities.  It may be that the inevitable conclusion with socialized healthcare is that a vast % of health costs are externalized and thus âthe peopleâ have a legitimate interest in determining your personal health treatment.</p>
<p>I think the current health system is rotten. But people should at least be wary of all variants of socialized health.  At its core socialism is in conflict with individual liberty.  </p>

<p>The economy and society, it's arts and legislation has been in the hands of the elite for decades, if not longer.  So that every year we have a nation better fitted, more rewarding, more in control of the elites.</p>
<p>By and large, elites have had no problem with putting to death steel towns, manufacturing cities, licensing and regulating and expensing out the working class from boating, hunting.</p>
<p>Even yuppie urban planning of having working class neighborhoods within walking distance of mills, pubs, stores.  Oh, it's OK for yuppies to have fake 'village centers' with boutique 'shoppe(s)', but God forbid the mis mash cacophony of a real, blue collar town with out doctoral degreed architectural 'renewal' with the effect of higher taxes and displacement of working class for DINK couples, black t-shirted artists and Starbucks.</p>

<p>There's not one word on the inavailability of perishable foods in these blog entries, primarily fruits and vegetables!</p>
<p>I'm from Illinois and am currently in south america.  Even in the poorest neighborhoods in south america, fresh fruit are readily available on every corner.  Within 200 yards of the home where I am staying , there are 4-5 corner shops selling mangos, pineapple, bananas, plantains, and other fresh perishable foods high in nutrients and low in calories.  </p>
<p>Try and find fresh fruits in a poorer neighborhood in Illinois, where many of the obese reside.  Chemicals, corn syrup, and other processed food fillers now fill our grocery stores and are the foods primarily available to the poor.  </p>
<p>Instead of subsidizing corn and wheat, the government should subsidize smaller localized farms that produce high nutrient perishable foods, as well as create incentives for small businesses in neighborhoods that lack availability to provide perishable healthy foods.  Also, most perishable foods need to be farmed by hand, creating many jobs that require burning hundreds of calories throughout the day.</p>
<p>Because non-perishable foods are more economically efficient(lower production cost, shelf life, easier distribution), our country has created this health epidemic for the benefits of stockholders in large companies producing and selling these foods.  How many well educated people with million dollar stock portfolios do you see having kraft easy-mac for lunch, McDonald's for dinner, coca-cola with both and a six-pack of busch for desert?    The rich have the availability to eat healthy...the poor often can not make that choice no matter how much they desire to do so.</p>
<p>While universal healthcare is bound to be inefficient, costly, and ill-thought, it is infinitely better than our current culture which pushes unhealthy foods, prescriptions, and illegal drugs on the lower rungs of our society for the benefit of the rich.  The current system is purely evil.  For some reason I believe inefficiency is better than pure evil.</p>

<p>This discussion raises questions that most of us had rather not reflect upon too closely but needs to be dealt with if we are to live in a free society.  Here are the options for the horrible decision that we must come to as a political community:  if we allow people the liberty to control their own property, which includes their own bodies, then we must allow them to suffer the consequences of their reckless decisions.  Otherwise, we will simply encourage escalating levels of self-destructive behavior whose costs progressively impinges on all of us.  If we decide to bail out those who will not or cannot properly regulate their desires, then we must limit their liberty.  In very blunt terms, we must choose between Social Darwinism and a type of serfdom or semi-slavery.  The humanitarian ethic of allowing and even facilitating all that people want to do regardless of their capacities and alleviating them of the full consequences of their behavior will destroy the liberty and prosperity of all.  Such a contradictory policy cannot be sustained.</p>

<p>According to USA Today, July 28, 2009, 34% of Americans are obese.  The obese have $1,429 more in medical cost each year.  Using these figures, the obese are increasing the average medical cost and average personâs insurance premium by more than $475 a year for every American, obese or not.</p>
<p>There also needs to be a sugar, alcohol and tobacco tax to cover these costs.  Think of how many less people there will be with diabetics, heart disease, rotten teeth, etc. if sugar became less affordable.  It's time for the people to take control of their own lives.  Itâs not fair for the person who chooses not to smoke, not to drink alcohol or not to drink a two liter of Coke each day to be responsible for paying as much as the person who chooses these unhealthy habits.  The government is so quick to change the companies, but what are they doing to regulate what those who choose unhealthy lifestyles and drive up the health cost of health insurance premiums for us all?</p>
<p>Introducing a public health plan needs to be removed from the current legislative bill.  Were in a recession and the government needs to realize they would be spending money on something that will hurt the economy and destroy an industry.  There have been too many quick, not thought out and irrational decisions made by our government lately and it makes me wonder, do they want our economy to ever recover?  There are far more important things this money can be used for and Washington needs slow down and focus on smart healthcare reform and getting it right the first time.</p>
<p>The insurance industry is already getting hit hard by the recession.  Too much to quick will bankrupt the insurance companies and ultimately there will be bigger problems than there is now.  The government needs to give insurance companies a chance under the new reform rules and each company should be required to prove themselves while getting used to all the new industry changes.  A public option should be a last resort and done only if the health industry doesn't improve.  Give the companies a chance first.</p>
<p>As for the Exchange, it's not needed.  The administrative cost of the Exchange will be more than what agents get paid now.  Government employees are more expensive because of all the benefits they receive from the government.  Most agents are self employed and responsible 100% for their own benefits and retirement plans.  Most people prefer having an agent help them apply and answer questions to eliminate errors.  Why change something that already works.  Most people prefer and already know what to expect with how things work now.  If trying to reach someone at the Exchange is anything like trying to get someone on the phone at the Social Security or Medicare offices, we all can expect to wait on hold for at least 20 minutes before we finally get to speak with a live person.  Thatâs 20 minutes of your or mine that is wasted.</p>
<p>Finally, the amount the government pays a doctor needs to be the same as what an insurance companies pay for the same service.  It needs to be mandated that all companies and the government should all be on the same pay schedule, including Medicare.  Letâs be fair.</p>

<p>I am a retired 61 year old RN.  Hubby and I have owned and operated a small grocery store in upstate NY since 1978.</p>
<p>Yes--we are eating wrong for several reasons.  Women work outside of the home.  Both my and hubby's Mom stayed home.  It is difficult for these young gals to come home at 6PM, supervise the homework, do the house tasks, baths, pack lunches, etc--and cook dinner in the amount of time it takes.  Too much take out.  My Mom could stay home because gov't was so much smaller and didn't claim so much of Dad's income and no such thing as all these hidden taxes.</p>
<p>Owning a grocery store -- many ppl do not realize that our national food stamp program allows the purchase of sodas, candies, confections, chips, dips and ice creams.  Since '78 I am seeing the sale of more and more junk on food stamps.  Mothers filling their toddlers bottles with Mt. Dew.  Oh--no toilet paper allowed--but all the candy bars they can eat.</p>
<p>It IS socio-economic in large part.  Kids with cash have been taught to purchase differently.  Juices, vitamin-waters--and not soda.  Fruit snacks--not chips. etc.  Education in the home is where is starts.</p>
<p>Oh--this fat soda tax.  This is just brilliant.  It is being proposed as a pre-paid tax.  Meaning, the retailers will pay the wholesalers.  It cannot be backed out at the retail register, like sales taxes.  If it is placed on that product (or any other fatty items) why is it allowed by food stamp recipients?  Talk about blowing it out of both ends.</p>
<p>Why not require cashiers to have nursing degrees?  This way while we check them out, we can give them their insulin injections--bill the feds in one swoop and eliminate an agency?</p>
<p>Food stamp (now SNAP) collects no data--other than random sampling--on what is being purchased.  Since '78 I am only required to carry certain stock--but nothing reported as part of my sales.  Never even been sampled.  I take home most of that healthy required stock before it goes bad--just to comply.  I replace it--and sell the crap junk--left and right.</p>
<p>If you think this is only chump change and not creating fat ppl--you are wrong.  I have been observing this since '78--these kids do not walk any more--they waddle--all bought by the taxpayer.</p>
<p>The program needs to be changed.  Years ago it was so the kids didn't feel differently than the cash paying ppl.  It made sense then--because they had more sense then--but today--it's bad--really bad.</p>

<p>The article is gesturing in the right direction but the whole field needs to be "dug up" by a scholarly study of the distortive effects of agricultural subsidies on the price of fatty and calorie-laden foods, particularly sugar, dairy products, corn syrup and red meat, especially beef and pork. The US and the EU in particular are handing over billions in taxpayer subsidies to farmers to produce these foods in particular, depressing world prices while fostering poor eating habits and thus obesity among the price-sensitive first world poor. Taxing subsidised food would be a start but removing the pernicious subsidies that cause the problem in the first place would be better.</p>

<p>For proponents of the added cigarette tax:</p>
<p>It has given rise to the "New Speak Easy" business. Somewhere in your town or on your city block--out of the trunk of a car is a person selling tax free cigarettes. On the average--they are 10-25 bucks per carton cheaper than in legit stores.  They will sell to your kids, too.  Hundreds and hundreds of cartons are being purchased by non-natives from Indian reservations.</p>
<p>They do not have payroll, contribute to social security, pay sales taxes, property business tax, etc.  The profits are huge.  All expense free, except for cost of goods.  Hell, while there, at the reservation--they gas up the cig-mobile tax free.  </p>
<p>Does anyone recall our history--Volstead Act?  Why are we always so quick to tax and punish and never think through the consequences?</p>
<p>I own a small grocery store.  I have even had a cig-runner set up shop in my damn parking lot.  I called 4 gov't agencies to report this.  NONE of them handle it.  To have enough law enforcement surrounding these reservations to stop this cigarette flow would cost more than the SCHIP expense.</p>
<p>Smoking stats are saying it is down.  Those stats mainly come from a tax stamp count.  The trunk cigs do not have a stamp. While NYS inspectors come in routinely and check my stock for the stamp--they do not even know the man with the full trunk exists.</p>
<p>Are we this stupid, now?   Don't think this only is a few under-the-table sales--it's a HUGE new cottage industry.  The elites push for these taxes--they are not in their neighborhoods--they are in mine.</p>
