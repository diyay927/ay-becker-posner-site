Total medical costs are about 15 per cent of GDP, and are continuing to rise. Medicare is some 20 per cent of this total, and its share will grow significantly in the coming decades as the population ages, and as new medical technologies develop. Many people are under the misperception that aging of the population is the main driver of the growth in medical expenses, but health economists have demonstrated that this is false. The more important reason is greatly increased medical spending at each age, especially at older ages. Expensive treatments and drugs have been developed to treat heart conditions, cancers, and other diseases, to replace and repair hips and other parts of the body, and simply to keep people alive. 

A reasonable question would be why complain since the value placed on advances in both the quantity and quality of life at older (and younger) ages have far exceeded the increased spending on medical care- my colleagues Kevin Murphy and Robert Topel have demonstrated this in important studies. But the system can be made much better, as long as changes bolster the weak parts of the American medical system, and do not tear down the many strong parts.

I concentrate these brief comments on one problem only, the excessive use of hospitalization and expensive surgeries under both private and public systems of payment.  One major reason for this excessive use depends on �political� considerations, while the other depends on economic reasons.

Politically, it is very difficult to prevent expensive treatments from being used by persons who gain little.  To take one of many examples, removal of the prostate after detection of prostate cancer may be the best treatment for a younger person, but makes little sense for someone in his late �70�s or 80�s. Yet it is usually impossible to force patients who want that surgery to take instead much cheaper and more appropriate options, such as hormonal deprivation therapy, or doing nothing (�watchful waiting�).

Given that the U.S. is unlikely to be able to prevent excessive use of expensive options, we should try to find more approaches that are relatively cheap to use to treat additional patients, even when those patients are better treated in other ways. New drugs and improved understanding of the medical value of proper nutrition may both have high development costs, but they are cheap to extend to additional users, especially after patents expire and cheap generics enter. By contrast, hospitals have relatively constant costs of adding additional patients.

So I agree with Posner for this reason mainly, but also for the reasons he gives, that medicare and other medical systems should include drug coverage. The potential of drugs to reduce the total cost of treatment is provided by the evidence on costs of the antidepressants developed during the 1990�s. A recent study in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry shows that spending on anti-depressants increased from about $400 per depressed person in 1990 to about $1399 in 2000, but total spending per depressed person declined because expensive hospital stays fell by a lot. Moreover, antidepressants also allow many formerly depressed persons to lead reasonably normal lives.

Unfortunately, the 2003 Act that introduces drug coverage under medicare has serious flaws that needlessly increase its cost to the very high levels recently revealed by a government recalculation. For persons who elect this coverage, it pays fully up to the first $250 per year of drug expenses, then has no coverage-the famous �donut�- for additional drug expenses in the middle range, and finally it has insufficient coverage at the very high end. The total cost of this program could be significantly cut while eliminating the �donut� and raising high-end coverage by adding a sizeable deductible, perhaps as large as $1000. Incidentally, a not very well understood puzzle is why both private and public systems of medical payments, and also other types of insurance, generally have foolishly low deductibles. 

Another way to cut excessive use of medical care is to end the free riding by the approximately 40 million uninsured individuals who receive cheap care at emergency rooms of all hospitals, and as in-patients in public hospitals. To prevent that, everyone should be required to buy at young ages private catastrophic medical insurance that can be automatically extended. Medicaid would cover the poor who cannot afford to pay for this insurance (I cannot address the many problems of Medicaid here). Catastrophic insurance provides people with protection against their greatest fear: diseases and disabilities that require expensive treatments which they cannot afford. 

A third important change would be to encourage tax-free medical savings accounts that allow unused medical balances to be carried over from year to year. The advantages of medical saving accounts with carry over provisions is that they encourage economizing on non-catastrophic medical expenses, which would help take further waste out of the present system. 

Once these three reforms are in place, we can then start to �privatize� the medicare system for the elderly, except for those elderly who are poor enough to qualify for a government program like Medicaid that pays for their medical needs. The privatization of medical coverage of the elderly would be the dual to my proposal last week to privatize retirement incomes.

While reform of pay as you go social security gathers most of the headlines, the value of the looming �crisis� in the medicare system for the elderly is much bigger. Privatizing medicare would prevent that crisis from developing if combined with a system of compulsory catastrophic medical coverage, medical savings accounts, and greater emphasis on treatment by drugs and nutrition rather than by hospitalization and surgery.
