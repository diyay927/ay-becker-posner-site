			Various attempts have been made to introduce rules that
limit the aggregate level of federal spending, such as restricting the growth
in spending over time to be no greater than the growth in GDP (aside from
wartime and other emergencies). Balanced budget proposals do not limit spending
per se, but require that enough taxes be raised to cover whatever level of
spending passes the legislature and chief executive. However, neither spending
limits nor balanced budget rules have ever received enough votes from Congress,
although many states and local governments do require a (nominally) balanced
budget.
<p>The “debt ceiling” is much closer to balanced budget rules
than to limits on federal spending since it tries to cap the budget deficits
that are solely responsible for the growth in debt. As Posner shows, this
so-called “ceiling” is not really a ceiling since it can be lifted by a
majority vote in both houses of Congress combined with the support of the
President. In fact, Congress has raised the ceiling more than 85 times since
1940, and 11 times since 2001. </p>
<p>More economically meaningful ceilings would relate debt to
the level of GDP- and perhaps also to interest rates on the debt- since
countries with higher incomes and lower interest rates can afford to carry
higher debt levels. One good reason to have properly defined debt ceilings,
even though the President and Congress must approve every piece of spending and
taxing legislation, is to force politicians to discuss how this legislation
aggregates to produce shortfalls or surpluses between total spending and total
tax revenue. Budget deficits are far more common than surpluses in recent
decades.</p>
<p>A further possible reason for a proper debt ceiling is to
give “salience”, to use a term from psychology, to the deficit issue by
requiring explicit consideration of deficits that push debt above its ceiling.
Its salience is reinforced by media coverage of the debates over raising the
ceiling, and of the different positions on raising the ceiling by Republicans
and Democrats, or by different members within each Party. Studies in economics
as well as psychology have shown that salience can affect behavior, such as how
much people avoid flying after terrorist attacks on planes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the salience placed on raising the debt is
somewhat misplaced since the effects of governments on economic and social life
are mainly determined by the level and composition of government spending, not
by deficits or debt per se. Raising sufficient taxes to cover large and
excessive spending would be worse than keeping spending within reasonable
bounds while financing some with debt.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the only way to evaluate debt ceilings is to
determine how much they affect the level and composition of spending and taxation.
That would not be easy to do in a credible way because of the difficulty in
determining the counterfactual; that is, what would have been spending and
taxation by the federal government in the absence of the debt ceilings? Perhaps
that is why I have not found such a study.</p>
<p>While federal government spending in real terms has grown
manyfold since the end of World War II, the ratio of debt subject to the debt
limit to GDP was a manageable 57% in the year 2000. This ratio has grown
rapidly since then, especially during the past four years, and it is now about
98%, higher than most other rich countries. Clearly, debt ceilings have not
prevented spending and taxation from growing significantly over time. Nor would
the present ratio of debt to GDP be a big problem as long as interest rates
remain low. </p>
<p>I mentioned earlier that what counts most for an economy is
not the ratio of debt to GDP, but that of government spending to GDP. This
ratio will increase or decrease as GDP grows slower or faster than government
spending. A decline in this ratio would be achieved if GDP resumes its
long-term growth rate of a little over 3% per year, and if the growth in
entitlement and other spending were kept under control. It remains to be seen
whether the American economy will regain its long-term growth rate, and whether
interest groups and politicians will resist the temptation to have government
spendingcontinue to grow at a rapid rate.</p>
