<h3>Tax Complexity and the Cost of Compliance-BECKER</h3>
<p>As my wife and I were recently preparing our income tax data to give to our accountant, I began my annual guess about the cost of complying in the U.S. with the Federal Tax code. But instead of just shaking my head over it, as I usually do, I made a few simple calculations that I will share with our readers. I will also offer some suggestions on how to cut down drastically compliance costs and reduce the negative effect of federal taxes on the efficiency of the economy.</p>
<p>We spent at least 25 hours in 2005 preparing and keeping track of our 2005 income, deductible expenses, and other data relevant for tax purposes. Our accountant spent another 6 or so hours, so together our tax filing used over 30 hours. Last year the IRS processed about 130 million tax returns. If the average filer along with any professional help together spent about 20 hours, 2.6 billion hours would have gone into complying with the 2005 tax code. This may seem huge, but the Tax Foundation put much more effort into their calculations, and finds that about 6 billion hours were spent in complying with the federal income tax code alone. </p>
<p>Businesses spend many more hours than most individuals do, while many filers who primarily have taxes withheld by their employers spent less time because they use the "short" tax form. Still, over half of all filers consulted accountants, lawyers, or other professionals for assistance in preparing their taxes. During the tax season, apparently over 1 million persons work professionally helping others prepare their tax returns.</p>
<p>If we value my 2.6 billion hours estimate conservatively at an average of about $40 per hour because higher income filers and tax preparers spend many more hours in tax preparation than lower income filers, the aggregate cost of complying would be over $100 billion. This is almost 10 per cent of the approximately $1.2 trillion that will be paid in 2005 in federal income taxes. The Tax Foundation concludes that total compliance costs for 2005 will amount to $265 billion, or over 20 per cent of federal income tax revenue.</p>
<p>Even with my lower estimate, compliance costs are big, despite the availability of computer software that greatly helps in tax preparation. The culprit is clearly the complicated tax code that has produced over 66,000 pages of federal tax rules. Of course, these complications are not there by accident, but are the result of pleadings and lobbying (see our discussion last week of lobbying) by special interests for favorable tax considerations. These include efforts by builders and home owners to get the government to allow deductions for interest paid on mortgages, by philanthropic organizations and universities to have charitable contributions deductible from reported income, by state and local governments to allow the deductibility of state and local income and property taxes, by industries lobbying to get accelerated depreciation on capital purchases, and special tax provisions for the oil and gas industry. They also include lobbying by financial institutions to get incomes accumulated in IRA's to be tax free, by employers and other groups that prefer the earned income tax credit over more generous welfare payments, and so on for the many pages in the tax code.</p>
<p>These numerous provisions not only enormously raise the direct cost of tax compliance, but cause many changes in behavior to take advantage of favorable treatments in the tax code. These alterations in behavior, like expenditures on compliance, usually make the economy less efficient, whether because many talented lawyers and accountants spend their time finding tax loopholes, or because too many and very large houses are built to take advantage of the favorable tax treatment of housing expenses, or because of many other changes in behavior.</p>
<p>Complications in the tax code are an excellent example of the conflict that sometimes arises between what is rational at the individual level, and what is rational to society as a whole. Each interest group lobbies to promote the interests of its members, although their interests advance usually at the expense of the interests of others. When many groups succeed in promoting their interests, losers vastly outweigh winners since each group gains from what they do, but loses from what is done to them by hundreds of other powerful interest groups.</p>
<p>There is no magic cure to this problem, at least none that I have encountered. Still, it is valuable to see clearly the problems and how they might be corrected because the future may provide opportunities for reform that are not presently available. A window of opportunity could arise to implement thoroughgoing changes that are not now politically feasible. One example of this kind of process is the voluntary army: a pipedream in the 1950's and 1960's became feasible in the 1970's because of the discontent over the draft during the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>The only way to radically reduce compliance costs is to engage in drastic surgery on the complexities of the tax code. The best approach would be to essentially eliminate all deductions, and have tax rates based just on total consumption, or as a second best alternative, just based on total income. Then compliance costs would be small because taxes owed could be calculated on a form the size of a postcard.</p>
<p>Such a radical simplification is often confused with a flat tax, which is a tax that is the same percent of income at all income levels. But eliminating all special deductions and benefits does not imply a flat tax, nor does a flat tax imply enormous tax simplification. In fact, most people who propose a flat tax really are proposing a progressive tax structure since they want incomes below a certain level to be free of all income taxes, and then a constant tax rate on each dollar of income about this minimum level. One could still have low compliance costs with a greater degree of progression in rates if tax rates started at zero and rose as incomes increased. Most degrees of tax progression are consistent with low compliance costs, although the more complicated the degree of tax progression, the greater the alterations in behavior that reduce an economy's efficiency.</p>
<p>To return to the cost of tax compliance, it is obviously excessive and socially wasteful. It is not easy to be optimistic about the prospects for tax simplification since the fundamental trend over time in the United States has been a steady increase in the complexity of the tax code. But at some future time, concern over the social waste in compliance costs that amounts to between 10 and 20 percent of total revenue produced by the income tax may galvanize American taxpayers into a revolt that, at least for a while, would result in drastic simplifications of the tax code.</p>

<p>The politics of income tax reform are intractable.  You aren't easily going to get rid of the mortgage interest deduction, for example, and because so many expectations were based on it, I'm not certain we should.</p>
<p>I haven't read the calculations lately, but my recollection is that a value added tax, basically a sales tax, that exempts food and clothing would have about the same progressivity as the income tax.  In those countries that rely primarily on a VAT, are the costs of collection less than our income tax system?</p>
<p>There are too many bells that can't be unrung--federal entitlements, "helping" bureaucracies with entrenched unions and lobbies, tax exemptions and credits favoring K Street clients, defense industries based on defending against yesterday's threats instead of todays--that I'm not sanguine at all about changing the tax system for the better. </p>
<p>We're headed for hell in a handbasket. The only satisfaction is that Canada and Europe are already in warmer territory thatn we.</p>

<p>I am somewhat skeptical of Prof Becker and the tax foundations estimates.  It only takes me a couple of hours to prepare my taxes, and I use the long form with itemized deductions.  Admitedly I earn nearly all of my income through normal wages (as opposed ot haivng my own business) which makes the whole process much simpler.  However, I woudl question how much incremental work keeping tax books is.  For example Prof Becker suggests that he and his wife spent 25 hours preparing documents to give to the accountant.  However, it is not clear whether this time was in addition to personnal accounting that is necessary to make sure one is living within one's budget, making proper investments etc.  In addition, I know that by setting one's personal accounting system up properly to begin with it is easy to generate a report of deductible expenses at the end of the year.  </p>
<p>Even if Prof Becker has properly counted his pure tax preparation time (and has efficiently set up his peronal accounting system) I would suspect his time costs are in the tiny minority.  The simple reason is that his financial situation is (I would suspect) relatively complicated.  Presumably he earns income from a number of sources (teaching investments, speaking, writing etc) and with this has a nubmer of deductions. For tihs reason, I would suspect the amount of time he spends is well above average.</p>

<p>I agree that income tax for wage based income isn't that hard but taxes can get very complicated once investments are added in. If you believe the Republicans that people should provide for their own retirement then everyone needs a lot of investments.<p>Let's consider some numbers. These days a couple needs about $50,000 per year to live comfortably not counting extra expenses like house and car payments. That means that a couple that retires at 65 and expects to live to 85 needs to have a million dollars in investments at age 65 in addition to having already completed payments on their house and cars.<p>To save up a million dollars by age 65 a couple would have to be putting $30,000 per year into a retirement account starting at age 35 (in addition to paying off the house and putting the kids through college). That means that even by age 40 a couple should have $150,000 in investments. If the couple's investments are properly diversified that is going to involve at least 10 separate investments all of which are likely to accrue dividends and interest and capital gains and losses. This will be further complicated by tax breaks that are given to retirement accounts.<p>Now, in the past, some people could rely on working for a single company their entire lives that would provide a sufficient retirement pension. In this case, the tax calculation burden was largely transferred to the company. In the modern economy where workers change jobs every few years, the burden of retirement planning falls on the individual and that can involve very substantial amounts of time for calculating taxes properly.</p></p></p></p>

<p>Dear Prof. Becker, I agree with your analysis about the high compliance costs under the current system of taxation and the need for simplication.  Indeed, I would go as far as to argue that the compliance costs under the current system are so large that there is an "optimal" amount of tax evasion; that is, that in some cases full compliance with the current system discourages productive activity, so that in these cases, evasion would be preferable from a "wealth maximization" persperctive.  Of course, even if my hunch is correct, it would be a thorny empirical question to determine how much tax evasion is "optimal", but my larger point is that the more complex the system is, the more optimal evasion would be.</p>

<p>I would separate the complexity of tax calculation into three kinds:</p>
<p>1) Complexity of a purely mathematical kind: the number of figures which have to be considered and all the additions, subtractions, multiplications, and divisions which have to be performed on them.  In the modern world, this kind of complexity should no longer be of any significance since it can all be done by computer.</p>
<p>2) Recordkeeping: the burden of monitoring economic activity and recording transactions in a form that tax software can work with.  Since almost everything can now be paid for electronically, it is also within our power to make this very easy if we choose.</p>
<p>3) Legal judgment: the need to know which provisions of the tax code can be or should be applied, and how transactions can be or should be characterized (e.g., whether an expense is deductible or not).  This will be harder to computerize than the first two elements.  Nevertheless I foresee that future taxpayers will be able to do this quite easily with the aid of sophisticated software.</p>
<p>There are some short-term obstacles.  Some people still do not have computers, or credit cards.  People may prefer recordkeeping to be difficult: for example, online businesses and their customers have an incentive to plead difficulty in calculating state use tax, and thereby avoid paying it, although recording and collecting the tax would in fact be very easy.  But in the big picture, it seems to me that escalating complexity of the tax code will not be able to keep up with Moore's Law, and paying one's taxes is going to get easier and easier.</p>
<p>I predict, for example, that tax preparation will not be a growing profession in coming years, although like secretaries and travel agents, tax professionals will not become wholly extinct.</p>

<p>The General Accountancy Office (www.gao.gov) issued a report (11 April 2003, "Record Increase in Agencies' Burden Estimates) estimating a total US government paperwork burden of 8.2 billion hours, with the IRS accounting for 6.7 billion hours.

<p>I'm sure that Becker and Posner have complicated taxes, but most Americans do not. My household income is 90th percentile and it only takes me a few hours to do the federal and state income tax forms. It would take even less time if my wife didn't have freelance income. The belly-aching about the complexity of taxes comes mostly from the affluent or from people who find it hard to add, subtract, and multiply whole numbers. They should use a calculator.<br/>
<p><br/>
Instead of reducing the complexity of the tax code, which is a utopian project in a large and complicated democratic society, we could try to increase the financial and mathematical literacy of ordinary Americans. Many who go to H&amp;R Block should be able to do their taxes on their own and save the fee. Investment in these basic skills would have benefits beyond tax preparation. <br/>
<p><br/>
So let's require anyone who graduates from high school to be able to calculate the 1040 form for someone with a W-2, a modest amount of interest income, a mortgage, and charitable contributions. There is plenty of slack in the high school curriculum to teach such a valuable life skill.</p>

<p>Come on people. I did my taxes in 4 hours (including state taxes), and I got a nice refund. It isn't that hard. If it is so hard, you all must be much richer than me, and, you now, have retarded dependents, run charities, own farms, and make a habit of short-selling whaleskin futures. And I did it without a computer, thank God. We shouldn't force people to use computers if they don't want to. It is unnatural and oppressive.</p>

<p>I don't think "people should be able to do their own taxes, and quickly" is any argument in the discussion about the complexity of the tax code. </p>
<p>For one, society would be better off if people didn't have to spend their valuable time adding and subtracting and could use that time productively, or for leisure. <br/>
Second, record-keeping creates a real and significant time-cost that is just not noticeable because it is spread out throughout the year; thus, Prof. Becker's estimate of 25 hours is probably just barely above average when these hours are included. <br/>
Third, forcing or even encouraging people to simplify their sources of income to avoid compliance costs is inefficient, because when compliance costs wipe out the gains of an activity, that activity will not be undertaken, to the detriment of the economy. </p>
<p>So, arguing the numbers in this case won't contribute to the discussion about the overly complicated tax code, which is a real problem. Whatever the number is, whether $265 million or $26.5 million, the question is whether that number is too high [inefficient] and what it should be. </p>

<p>what's so bad about forcing people to spend a few hours each year to determining their tax liabilities?  i agree that the code is too complex, but the time spent preparing taxes isn't all for naught-- it's good that people have to sit down and realize that providing this country's massive entitlement programs requires contribution, and it's good that people are forced every year to sit down and look how much they are contributing.</p>

<p>A reminder, because it appears you missed the point of this week's post, which is that the economy-wide cost of doing taxes is a significant and probably excessive fraction of the tax take.</p>

<p>The primary problem in moving to a tax that is very simple is putting together the transition.  The standard flat tax proposal has a tax base very similar to a consumption-based value added tax.  As you point out, this will create winners and losers.  It seems to me that providing a transition that would phase out exemptions and deductions, grandfather in certain items, etc,. while potentially creating a more compicated code in the short run, might allow a simple tax to emerge in the long run.</p>

<p>Very interseting arguments.  </p>
<p>One additional cost to tax-payers that is not accounted for in any of the above estimates is the opportunity cost of provide funds to the government interest free.</p>
<p>If the population of the US were to, on average, overpay taxes then we would also have to add the cost of missed investment to the estimates above. </p>
<p>Don't know off the top of my head if the US population tends on average to over/under pay their taxes.</p>
<p>Also, there has not been much discussion of the potentially economically inefficient behaviors people engage in to take advantage of the tax system.  For example, over-investment in real estate, or holding on to stocks too long in order to qualify for better tax treatment.</p>

A postcard-size tax form is a silly objective to have.<br/></p>
<p>Income taxation is complex because the *definition* of periodic income is inherently complex. A true consumption tax is no simpler. (How do you tax consumer durables without distoring own vs. rent incentives?)<br/></p>

<p>While all the simplification ideas are great (whether flat or progressive) I don't see how any reform can be credible.  If the change is only temporary (say for 15-20 years) before Congress starts making additional impositions will the transition costs (likely to be large) have been worthwhile?</p>
<p>Unlike the volunteer army, the advantages of tax simplification may be negated if those changes can be undermined by a variety of retro-taxes and exemptions in the future.</p>

<p>Wonderful sentiment - seasonally timed, and as you point out yourself: politically impossible.  So, where to start?  (You say you want a revolution.... well you know....)<p></p>
<p>I say we need to reform the creation of laws - and somehow take that activity out of the hands of the (self-interested) lawyers.  Most educated citizens today are as competant (sp?) as lawyers of the 1700s, why not erase the bar?  Perhaps with more complication in the tax codes making it economically unattractive to provide legal counsel in all but the most basic of cases - bring lawyers fees down to where they can make no more than the clients they represent.<p></p>
<p>With strong financial disincentive toward the legal profession, there should be an eventual erasure of needless complication, obfuscation, and other machinations which keep the lawyers in business today.  There's no reason why government can't be transparent to all, with easy access to all laws, records, decisions, etc. from the home library (internet connection.)  I'm sure we could retrain a small percentage of the lawyers out there to serve in the information technology field, enough to keep everyone's computers running.<p></p>
<p>Tax law is just one small example of the waste of effort society endures for the sake of making a minority a little bit wealthier, at a greater cost to the majority.</p></p></p></p>

<p>To all those who responded with arguments specifically attuned to my "non"-argument,</p>
<p>1. Anyone who has trouble doing their taxes deserves it, because they have so much money and engage in so many complex transactions that hundreds upon hundreds provisions of the tax code apply to them that their corporation's accountant should be doing the taxes;<br/>
2. For the average literate citizen who keeps his W-2 and any envelopes marked "Important Tax Information" handy, doing taxes should take no more than 5-10 hours, without a calculator. if it takes any longer than that, your W-2 and any such envelopes aren't kept handy, or you are illiterate.<br/>
3. Given that filing taxes is so easy and simple to do for the average literate citizen, forcing everyone to purchase a computer, or spending tax dollars to do so, is a waste. It also calls into question the motives of people who want the tax code changed. Any change will shift the burden off them, for whom doing taxes is difficult, to me, for whom doing taxes presently is easy. Why, exactly, should I subsidize your laziness? I shouldn't. Whining about doing your taxes is what isn't an argument, you lazy cretin.<br/>

<p>For those of you who didn't get it the first two times: it's not your tax code that is too complex, it's you that is too lazy. </p>
<p>And I will add that the tax code is quite efficient. All sorts of goodies are in there, that save all sorts of people cash. Not you, perhaps. But someone. And that someone was given cash by their representative in Washington. Every provision of the tax code is proof of a political deal. Politicians exist to allocate resources, and the tax code is the Rosetta Stone of it. The tax code is quite efficient at what it exists to do, which is distribute goodies to the people who bothered to vote. I voted, so I love the tax code.</p>

<p>Prof Becker,<br/>
But isnt the time people spend doing taxes in some sense optimal in that if taxes were straightforward people would become less bothered by them. To put in differently, the time lost makes the burden of paying tax more salient engendering opposition to taxation. I think Milton Friedman made this argument, Im not sure. Basically, if the government could easily tax us painlessly, the upshot would be larger government and, ultimately, less efficiency.</p>

<p>Yes, the tax code should be simplified.  In some states, it's actually very simple.  For example, Pennsylvania's tax forms are quite easy.  They tax the hell out of you, but doing them is not that painful.  The federal government could easily follow this state or another state.  They would save a fortune and save the public a lot of grief.</p>

<p>As I noted above compliance costs ofr most individuals are trivial (unless you have difficulties with arithmetic).  One of the areas that introduces huge complexity, however, involves tax depreciation for business.  This basically reduces the taxes of businesses that have made a lot of recent investment.  Given that economists normally dislike taxation of investment income (since it is thought to distort investments) this is a good thing.  Of course it would be even better (in this view) to reduce the rate of taxation on businesses; however, I would suggest that this would be politically impossible. The majority would have a serious problem with the idea that corporations are paying lower taxes than some poor shlom working at McDonalds.  Therefore if we are in a world of second best where the current corporate rates cannot be changed, the question becomes whether the benefits from accelerated depreciation outweigh the compliance costs.  I woudl strongly suspect they do since businesses could always choose to forgo accelerated depreciation, yet almost no businesses make this choice. </p>

<p>I have a more modest proposal.  I'd like the IRS to create a separate set of forms for people who can handle complex mathematical operations.  Surely Professor Becker and his colleagues could do it faster if they didn't have to comply with instructions like  "Enter the number from line 6 on line 7.  Is the number on line 7 greater than the number on line 4?  Which is greater 2 or 1?  Enter the number from line 7 on lines 8,9, and 16.  Now add zero to the number you entered on line 12..."</p>

<p>I don't find Becker's ideas here very convincing.</p>
<p>Even granting the the 20-hour average, which seems high to me, eliminating deductions would make much less difference than he claims. Only about a third of all returns itemize deductions. No doubt some taxpayers who don't itemize still calculate deductions before deciding, but it still seems safe to say that well under half of taxpayers would save any time at all if there were no deductions.</p>
<p>For those with complicated business affairs a fair amount of  time is involved in determining income. It's pretty simple for those who have only labor income and ordinary interest and dividends - a large majority of returns. But those for whom it is complex are not helped by eliminating deductions.</p>
<p>Nor is it clear how a consumption-based system would be simpler. Where and from whom would the tax be collected? How would the necessary reporting and auditing work? And not incidentally, how would the various problems of a consumption tax - transitional issues, regressiveness, for starters - be handled without introducing complex reporting? </p>
<p>The complexity could even be greater than today's. It might not be, but a simple assertion, even from Gary Becker, is not enough to prove the point.</p>

<p>My theory in a nutshell is simple: I don't think the number of hours spent preparing a tax return should differ greatly from one household to the next.  That's why ever since I took an interest in taxes, I've been advocating a position quite similar to the one espoused by Gary Becker.  Of course, I don't think some of his estimates (regarding total hours spent) are correct, but that's a battle that need not be fought at this time. It would be better handled at a lecture or conference.</p>

<p>A missed issue here is whether or not the time spent preparing taxes, by an individual or tax preparer, would be otherwise spent productively. Perhaps during the weeks prior to tax day the typical individual taxpayer spends a few less hours on the couch watching American Idol. If this is the case, the time spent preparing their taxes would not be taking away from the national productivity at all. Possibly even adding to the productivity for the weeks following the tax-filing deadline, given some individuals may find light in there new (yet temporary)  more productive ways.</p>

<p>W-if I didn't have to begin working on my taxes for next year, I'd have time to rebut virtually every one of your points.  You've presented a target-rich opportunity.  For instance, "Anyone who has trouble doing their taxes deserves it, because they have so much money and engage in so many complex transactions that hundreds upon hundreds provisions of the tax code apply to them"---Huh?  Our most productive people should be encumbered by the tax code because they're productive?  They should be freed up to be more productive.</p>
<p>Hey, one more, then I gotta go find some envelopes for my receipts:  "And I will add that the tax code is quite efficient. All sorts of goodies are in there, that save all sorts of people cash. Not you, perhaps. But someone. And that someone was given cash by their representative in Washington."  Uh, Dub, whenever someone in Washington "gives" us cash, they have to first "take" it from somebody else.  They don't actually produce anything in Washington.  And, just as they "give" it through the tax code, they "take" it through the tax code.</p>
<p>I've always thought that one sure-fire way to get some serious tax reform started would be to end payroll tax withholding and require everyone to write a check once a month or once a quarter to the government.  That way, Joe Six-Pack gets a true feel for how much tax he's paying.  Ought to take about two payment cycles for the tax revolt to begin.  It'll never happen.</p>

<p>I think the way to phase out a bloated tax system is to give the taxpayer a choice.  Let the politicians mess with the 66000 page tax code as much as they want but require all businesses and individuals who have never paid tax to pay a flat / simple / whatever rate and allow those who are under the current system to stay under the current system.  Then give all current taxpayers a choice each year.  Stay with the existing code or move the simple code.  Once you go simple though, you can't go back.</p>

<p>As a student of Arthur Laffer and Paul Craig Roberts, I wrote a Senior Thesis in 1985 titled "Tax Reform and Deficit Reduction", which was a beautiful, 150 plus page treatise arguing the supply-side benefits of lowering taxes to increase revenue.  I have written countless editorials on this and many other subjects over the years, to no avail.  The facts are indisputable; the supremacy of politcs over reality in this country is maddening to the point of fomenting revolutionary thoughts among previously level headed individuals.  The failure to address: Tax Reform (especially to repeal the insidious AMT tax)/Border Patrol-Illegal Immigrant Reform/Wasteful Govt. spending/Entitlement Reform/Social Security Reform/Nuclear Proliferation/etc., is leaving our children and grand children an insurmountable burden due to our greed - all sacrificed on an altar of political correctness.  Formally a life time Republican (Did I really vote for George Bush Senior [read my lips[, Junior [see the aformentioned] Reagan [remember TEFRA?]?), primarily to support the lesser of two evils, I have now sworn to NEVER vote for one of the two major candidates ever again.  The two party system has destroyed our country irreparably, and continues to force us into a downward spiral.  For those who think this was written by someone on the lunatic fringe, I refer you to the Declaration of Independence - and encourage all to read it again: "When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another.... it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government." </p>

<p>Why is it imperative to shut down the tax planning &amp; preparation business?  Since we have permanently moved into a service economy, we should be careful about wiping out industries because a group thinks its wasteful and its practitioners should be in more productive fields. </p>
<p>The government clearly butchered the job of creating a fair and easy revenue collection system, but here we are.  I believe it a far more benign government form of neglect than having the government select areas of human economy to be shut down.  </p>
<p>I understand the obvious difference that tax preparation is in some form government mandated (not all forms, though), but government mandates create multiple economies that seem excessivly complex(food regulation, immigration controls, schooling, travel, etc).  Collecting revenues is no less important than those areas, and the government is bringing its normal ineptitude in execution. At least this one creates high paying jobs.</p>
<p>I don't recognize this as a problem not because it would disappear in a perfect world, but because while we live under a massive and imperfect government, why should we spend our shriveling spare time on this matter over FAA, FDA, DEA, NEA and other wasteful government created economic sectors?  </p>

<p>The transfer is all too efficient.  That?s the problem.  Our legislators are painfully efficient at misallocating resources from point A to point B.  My concern is not one of efficiency; my concern is for the enormous hole on the eastern shore into which money is poured, never to be filled.  Politics does indeed trump reality in this day and age.

Actually, I don?t think they are complaining about doing their taxes.  I live in a fairly high net worth retirement area, and most of them are out playing golf while their accountants do the taxes.  The problem, as pointed out by Mr. Becker, is the draining of resources required to comply with the tax code.  That time and money could surely be better spent doing almost anything else.  Somebody who is savvy enough to become wealthy and spends a couple thousand dollars a year on accountancy could surely put that money to better use than meeting the onerous requirements of our tax code, even if it's just to buy a case of golf balls to chase around the piney woods of North Carolina.<br/>

<p>There is something of a contradiction between the messages of last week on the cost of compliance and of the one before on lobbying. I mean, you can argue that there should be few constraints on lobbying (and he arguments sound  strong) and that the costs of tax compliance are high (they seem high indeed) but the second is to a large measure a result of the first. (Almost) everyone with a substantial stake in the tax system tries to change it in his favour without eliminating the overall tax base with as a result a very complex tax system and a not very wide tax base.</p>

<p>The pressure for an efficient tax system comes at the margin from efficient tax systems in other jurisdictions on the globe. The Cayman Islands and Hong Kong come to mind as examples. When efficient tax systems are available on the globe, they exercise magnetic effect on transactions and enterprises that are profitable and are not location specific. A great deal of investment capital has moved from the U.S. to the Cayman Islands, reducing the capital stock of the U.S.</p>
<p>Given a choice, an entrepreneur with a valuable business concept more often than not will place that business in a tax efficient jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Significant costs of the inefficient U.S. tax system include therefore the dimished capital invested in the U.S. and the new ventures not started in the U.S. </p>
<p>These costs go to a significant portion of the wealth of the Nation, and reducing them is necessary to maintain and increase that wealth at the margin.</p>
<p>There are offsetting benefits to the U.S. from the existence of tax efficient jurisdictions on the globe. U.S. enterprises removed to tax efficient jurisdictions eventually can enhance the capital stock of the U.S. if and when their earnings or capital are brought back to the U.S. The government of the U.S. with a huge international float of its bonds benefits from ownership of its bonds in tax efficient jurisdictions. Demand for its bonds increases with an offsetting reduction in the U.S. government's interest expense. There is a huge pool of U.S. government bonds held in the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>The offsetting benefits from tax efficient jurisdictions to the U.S. are not likely to be of the same order of magnitude as the costs. Thus, on balance real gains in the wealth of the Nation are available from adopting an efficient tax system.</p>

<p>Dr. Becker,</p>
<p>thanks for your post.  some of these comments are especially enlightening.  I don't buy some of the class envy, income redistribution arguments here.  I do know it takes me a terrifically long time to do my taxes, and I have to devote a lot of storage space just for documentation.  </p>
<p>meanwhile, the paper trail that is generated from bank, brokerage, and other statements to satisfy IRS and legal requirements is mind boggling.  </p>
<p>I do think we need a revolution of the tax code.<br/>
It needs to be based on income, not on lobbyist postions.  In looking for a place to put income, and a place to retire, taxes are an integral part of the decision.  America is losing vital capital from its tax policy.</p>
<p>In looking at the structure of the code, it penalizes risk taking.  It penalizes small business.  These are just the things we should be advocating at this point in our countries development.  </p>
<p>And if I have to pay that da%$ AMT tax again I might begin to sympathize with the Unibomber!  </p>

<p>One comment that I'd be interested to hear an economist's (and Judge Posner's) perspective on:<br/>
Becker aludes to the special interest group sponsorship of the tax deduction for interest paid on home mortgages. This is indeed a type of special interest preference in the tax code, but only because of omission of deductibility of other types of loan interest paid. Consider--when taxpayer takes out a loan to buy, say, a car, the principal amount he borrows is not income. Why? Because the money received is offset by a corresponding obligation to pay it back. The same is true for a home mortgage loan, but the difference is the taxpayer also is not taxed on the income (or can deduct it subject to the 2% threshold anyway) necessary to pay the interest on the loan. Put this way, why not make all such interest deductible? When corporations issue bonds and other debt securities, all payments they make on these to securityholders are likewise deductible. The theory that should treat these situations uniformly is that as loans/debt obligations are not income, neither are the  expenses, including interest required to repay them. Such expenses are not "accession to wealth," the Supreme Court pronouncement on what "income" is. Student loan, credit card loan, auto loan, all types of business loan, etc. interest payments should also in theory be deductible. Further, it is my understanding of most versions of the tax code prior to 1986 that all interest was in fact deductible. So for the home loan interest deduction to persist is a special preference, but one that if expanded to its original parameters would have substantial justification. The arguments used by the housing industry in favor of the special preference are silly and self-interested (home prices of course adjust upward to account for likely tax savings, and thus no general incentive for home ownership over renting exists), but the basic theoretical point in favor of the deductibility of interest payments is perfectly sound.</p>

<p><i>At tax time, your fellow American may well go through your trash and, efficiently, profit thereby.</i></p>
<p>This only proves that the cost of buying a shredder, indexed to inflation, should be included as an itemized deduction or incorporated to the standard deduction amount. Those who choose not to purchase shredders and instead file online should be able to check a box for a reimbursement check.</p>

<p>W - you are confusing arguments over efficiency with concepts of effort and fairness, a fundamental error.</p>
<p>You accuse me of using labels not arguments and then call me an idiot.</p>
<p>Fine. Replace "pork barrel" with "the allocation of public funds according to political influence" in my comment above. Yours is still a wrongheaded argument.</p>

<p>Dr. Becker, it is gratifying to me to read your original 16 April posting and to know that someone of your intellectual caliber considers our US tax system to be a problem and recognizes the kinds of effort many of us have to exert to comply.  If anything, your estimate of 25 hours of effort on taxes is an underestimate.  Besides keeping records all year and organizing them at the end of the year, there is time for getting the forms or materials needed to prepare a return.  You have to do at least one of three things:  collect forms and read the instructions and revisions OR choose, install, and learn a tax preparation software, OR meet with an accountant or tax preparer.  It is possible that all three of these steps will need to be done.  Then, throughout the year anyone who has to make quarterly payments must keep up with all the calculations required to revise income to determine the amounts of those payments.  The smart tax payer also must try to determine changes that occur to the tax laws during the year, revising spending/giving/behavior as required to take maximum advantage of any changes.  </p>
<p>However, the time required to "do taxes" is only a part of the problem.  </p>
<p>Another problem is that most people don't pay attention to how much tax they pay.  Davey, I agree with you that making everyone send in quarterly tax payments would be a step in the right direction in making people aware of the size of their tax bite.  And to mvpy--I think you are on target in saying that taxing people easily (as through payroll withholdings) leads to larger government and less efficiency.  We certainly are there already!</p>
<p>I am not going to chime in on the price our country pays in lost efficiency, questionable social engineering agendas promoted by the tax code, or income redistribution, but all of those are serious problems.  Here is my main point:  I am surprised in reading all of the responses that one issue has not been raised, either by the writers who do their taxes in a few hours or by those who have to do more complicated filings.  If you get it wrong, the IRS has the power to brand you as a criminal.  Sure, you may only have to pay a penalty plus the back taxes, but if you run a small business, for example, your reputation and possibly your company's existence are on the line.  No mistake is considered innocent, even though the error may well fall into that category.  No one has time to run a business AND understand 66,000 pages of tax code.  The IRS has admitted to not understanding the tax code--how can anyone else?  That's why there are tax lawyers and tax approaches based on interpretation of court cases.  The whole system is scary, and we all should worry--even those of you who do 1040EZ--or whatever it is called now.</p>

<p>Someone who thinks that effort categorically has nothing to do with efficiency is an idiot. Calling you an idiot is not name-calling, it is a statement of fact.</p>

<p>Hi. To believe in God or in a guiding force because someone tells you to is the height of stupidity. We are given senses to receive our information within. With our own eyes we see, and with our own skin we feel. With our intelligence, it is intended that we understand. But each person must puzzle it out for himself or herself.<br/>
