<p>A more than 400 page recent report from The National Research
Council and The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences
(“U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health”)
finds that children, men, and women all have shorter life expectancies in the
United States than in Japan, Canada, Australia, and 13 European countries. Some
of the media comments on the report blame what they consider an expensive and inefficient
American healthcare system. Yet the report shows that many, perhaps most, of
the reasons behind why American life expectancy is lagging relates to lifestyle
decisions, and not to medical care.</p>
<p>The U.S. fared worse than these 16 other countries in 9
health categories: </p>
<p>1.     Infant
mortality and survival to age 5.</p>
<p>2.     Deaths
from car accidents and homicides.</p>
<p>3.     Adolescent
pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>4.     Prevalence
of HIV infection and AIDS.</p>
<p>5.     Deaths
from alcohol and use of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>6.      Chronic lung disease.</p>
<p>7.     Obesity
and diabetes.</p>
<p>8.     Disability
due to arthritis and other factors.</p>
<p>9.      Heart disease.</p>
<p>Most of these categories relate to lifestyle decisions
rather than medical care. For example, American deaths from car accidents is
greater mainly because Americans drive more since the report shows that
fatalities per mile driven is not higher in the U.S. Guns are far more common
and violence is much greater, in America than in these other countries. Deaths
from lung disease are more common in America because smoking was more common
here in the past. Americans are much more likely to use cocaine and other
drugs. That Americans are much fatter than individuals in these other countries
contributes to the greater incidence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. </p>
<p>The higher incidence of child mortality may be partly due to
poorer health care for disadvantaged pregnant mothers. However, this mortality
difference is also likely mainly due to the personal behavior of these pregnant
mothers than to any limited access to good health care.</p>
<p>The age pattern of American mortality rates also implies
that most of the higher mortality of Americans is not due to low quality health
care. The elderly are the recipients of a large fraction of health care
spending in all rich countries. In particular, over 35% of health care spending
in the United States is on persons aged 65 and older. The National Research
Council study shows American mortality rates are among the very highest up to
ages under 55, but mortality rankings begin to change quickly then. American
mortality is in the middle of the pack by the mid-seventies, and it is already relatively
lower by age 60.</p>
<p>To be sure, since the US spends a lot more per capita on
medical care than does any other country, the fact that American life
expectancy looks good at older ages does not imply that these expenditures are
wisely allocated or efficient. Ways to improve the efficiency of America’s
spending on health care are discussed in several of our past blog postings (the
most recent one is on January 6).</p>
<p>Even though most of the difference in life expectancy
between the US and these 16 peer countries are due to difference in personal
behavior, public policies should try to change some of this behavior. For
example, stiffer punishments for driving while drunk would reduce the incidence
of drunk driving, a major cause of American traffic fatalities. Greater
punishments for illegal possession of guns and for the use of guns to commit
crimes, and judicious tighter gun controls are likely to reduce deaths from
shootings, although there would be some compensating increases in stabbings and
other types of violence. Decriminalization of drug use would reduce the rate of
drug addictions and possibly even the number of drug addicts, increase visits
to clinics by those addicted to drugs, and lower the incidence of AIDS from
using contaminated needles (see the essay by Kevin Murphy and me “Have We Lost
the War on Drugs?” Wall Street Journal, January 5, 2013).</p>
<p>It is more challenging to decide what to do about the fact
that many Americans are overweight and obese. A recent survey of the evidence
in a number of countries shows that being overweight, as measured by BMI
(weight divided by height squared), does not lead to higher death rates except
at very high and very low BMI values (dissertations at the University of
Chicago under Robert Fogel’s supervision had already shown this). These studies
imply that taxes and regulations on fast foods that discourage their
consumption would mainly affect individuals whose eating patterns do not reduce
their life expectancy, although overweight individuals do make modestly greater
demands on the subsidized health care system.</p>
<p>The lower life expectancy for young and middle aged
Americans than in peer countries is a matter of public policy concern, but wise
policies require accurate knowledge about their causes. The comprehensive
National Research Council study suggests that the major causes lie in
differences in lifestyles between American and individuals in other countries.
Poorer access of some Americans to adequate healthcare seems to be of  relatively little importance. </p>
