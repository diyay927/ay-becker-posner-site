<h2>October  1, 2007</h2>
<h3>The Decline of Unions--Posner's Comment</h3>
<p>I agree with Becker that the settlement between GM and the UAW was a major victory for GM; I suspect that the strike was a face-saving gesture for the union's leadership--a pretense that the strike, that symbol of union power, had wrested important concessions from the company. What is significant about the health trust fund is not that it will remove a large contingent liability from GM's books--a matter simply of accounting--but that it will enable GM to cap that liability by paying a lump sum to create the trust, which then becomes responsible for the employees' (including retired employees') health costs. The risk of soaring health costs is shifted from the company to the workers. If the trust grows faster, through investment of its assets, than the health costs of the trustâs beneficiaries, the workers will do fine. If not, they, rather than GM, will be the losers. So a cloud of uncertainty over the company's future will be lifted.</p>
<p>The purpose of unions is simple: it is to increase unionized workers' incomes above the competitive level, where "income" includes not only wages and fringe benefits but also safety and other aspects of working conditions. The unions do this by cartelizing the sale of labor services. A union that organizes the work force of the major competitors in a market obtains monopoly power over the supply of labor to those firms, and that power enables it to negotiate better terms for its members than they could obtain in a competitive labor market. (The union cannot force the workers in the collective bargaining unit to join the union, but it can charge them an "agency fee" for negotiating on their behalf as well as on behalf of the union members.) The union takes a share of the monopoly gain in the form of union dues.</p>
<p>As with any monopoly, union cartelization causes inefficient substitution, whether of capital for labor or of production by nonunionized competitors, and it also generates rent-seeking costs--the costs to unions of organizing an employer's work force and the costs to employers of fighting union organizing efforts. Not only are union cartels inefficient, but they penalize the least productive workers, workers not worth the union wage to employers.</p>
<p>What has wrecked the unions, outside of the public employment sector, is the rise of competition in the product markets that used to provide the most favorable conditions for unionization. When thousands of workers are doing essentially the same work in the same plant in an oligopolistic industry, the cost of organizing is minimized. The existence of a large homogeneous work force reduces the cost of communicating the unionâs message and reduces conflicts of interest among workers that would make it difficult to agree to a common package of wages, benefits, and improved working conditions. With few producers, the cost of organizing the entire industry's work force is reduced and the benefits to the workers and to the union (in union dues and agency fees) increased. These conditions are most likely to be found in traditional assembly-line manufacturing, which as Becker notes has declined, in significant part because of the pressure of foreign competition. (That is why unions oppose free trade.) The more competitive an industry, the more difficult it is for unions to extract significant concessions from an employer: higher labor costs will simply deflect an employer's customers to his competitors. Unionization accelerates its own decline.</p>
<p>But the particular pickle that GM and the other American auto manufacturers, together with the UMW, find themselves in is also due partly to the U.S. tax code, which makes health benefits deductible to the employer and nontaxable to the employee. This unsound tax policy creates an incentive for the employer and the union to negotiate generous health benefits in lieu of generous wage increases--and without careful controls the employerâs obligations can skyrocket. "Lifetime" benefits can be a highly attractive perk if health costs rise only gradually, but if they rise rapidly (in part because of increasing longevity, in part because of better but more costly therapies) the employer may find himself saddled with labor costs that make his product noncompetitive. So GM and the other automakers took a big risk in agreeing to extremely generous health benefits, but so did the UMW. For it is difficult for a union to agree to retract concessions that it has obtained from the employers with whom it bargains; it signals weakness. But by hesitating to backpedal, the union has jeopardized the automakers' survival and by doing so has jeopardized its own survival--and guaranteed its decline. </p>
<p>Another factor in the decline of unions may, paradoxically, be the National Labor Relations Act, an important New Deal measure that has long been thought pro-union. Before the Act was passed, there was plenty of union activity (the percentage of the work force that was unionized was larger before the Act was passed than it is today), but because of the absence of a tight legal framework for union organizing, labor-management struggles were more like war than like political campaigning. There was a good deal of violence and the organizers, as underdogs, earned a large measure of public sympathy. The NLRA created a detailed legal regime of government-supervised electoral competition and negotiation; violence ceased to be a significant factor in labor relations--and the labor heroes disappeared, and with them unionization as a burning political issue.</p>
<p>As Becker notes, the area in which unions have made gains in recent decades is that of public employment. Public employment would always have been a fertile field for union organizing had it not been for laws forbidding strikes by public employees. Public employers provide services rather than products, and service interruptions due to strikes impose greater costs than interruptions in the production of goods because service cannot be produced for inventory or stored; public employees are voters and so government is reluctant to take tough measures against strikers; and public employers are generally monopolists. On all these counts, unionization today poses greater risks to efficiency in the public than in the private sector. In the private sector, the decline in unionization has greatly reduced the power of unions to extract supracompetitive wages and benefits--to the point where, the continued exemption of most union activities from the antitrust laws probably makes good sense. The benefits of antitrust enforcement against practices that nowadays have probably only a small effect on the efficiency of labor markets might well fall short of the costs in enforcement.<br/>

<p>One might equally observe that the purpose of large, hierarchical industrial organizations is much the same, though with an opposite aim, namely, to persuade workers that they should accept incomes below the competitive level.</p>

<p>"The purpose of unions is simple: it is to increase unionized workers' incomes above the competitive level, where "income" includes not only wages and fringe benefits but also safety and other aspects of working conditions."</p>
<p>I'm surprised (sort of) at Posner writing such an overly simplistic and misleading summary of the "purpose" of unions. There is a well-known inherent flaw in capitalism  in that  "many disorganized sellers will be at disadvantage to, few, organized buyers" resulting in the price being driven below the costs of production.  This is the case with generic commodities and low or semi-skilled labor and is the flaw that caused a LOT of problems at the turn of the century that gave rise to both farm price support programs and the labor movement.</p>
<p>One can pretty well spot the price taker class who is not at the bargaining table in the language  we use, as "What are THEY paying......" vs "We sat down and worked out an employment contract".  </p>
<p>Posner at least mentions safety and work condition  rules and perhaps working people of today should be reminded of workmen "standing by" all day for a couple of hours of work before agreements were made of a min number of hours for an employee who was called in to work.  Just recently Walmart proposed to return to those conditions of yesteryear by sending people home "during the slow hours".  Great! for low pay the employee comes in  "get's" a few hours, and then has a two or three hour "break" in which to drive back home or "stand by".</p>
<p>Posner mentions "above THE competitive level".  But does not discuss how that "level" is set. </p>
<p>There is another inherent flaw in capitalism; that is that the machine won't run "properly" at full employment.  The reason?  when demand is "too" high for working people the rascals will use that demand for their services to bid up their wages. Thus, we have The Fed sitting there adjusting the valves so that unemployment is never zero, and there is always competition for even the lowest paid jobs.  The  resulting "competitive level" then is hardly set by the gods or even "the invisible hand" of Adam Smith.</p>
<p>Posner and Becker both seem a little too joyful in  reporting on the weakness of today's union and labor movement.  Also, not long ago they gave our deeply eroded min wage a drubbing, and again, left out that it too was implemented as a counter to the effect of wages being bid down to zero and, again? tanking the whole system. </p>
<p>Lastly, they touch on there being far fewer UAW members today.  Well, there are benefits to industry for paying high wages; they have a higher incentive to find labor saving substitutes and "Detroit" now has more robots assembling cars than they have people which is a good thing and better for us all than having millions of very low paid workers being less productive. </p>
<p>Well, Prof Posner and Becker, after all the concern over min wage and union workers who might be paid over "the competitive" rates, perhaps a topic for next week might be that of the economic underpinnings that "explain" why CEO pay has soared 2000 percent to 500 times worker pay (up from 80 times in 1980) while those below median wage have seen virtually no increases and the min wage has lost 40% of its purchasing power? And whether Hail-Fellow Well Met old boyism plays the strong role that I suspect it does.  </p>

<p>Jake's comment is well taken. But I would argue that the relation btw. "labor" and "management" should be modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma -- that is, both sides want to reach some agreement on how to divide a pie -- ideally, they should reach some cooperative solution but in reality they will be tempted to defect, with each side attempting to apportion a larger size of the pie for themselves. </p>
<p>I myself sympathize with the plight of workers, but it is important to realize the importance of incentives -- if one side attempts to take too large a slice of the pie, there may be no pie left at the end of day -- this seems to be what has happened to unions in the private sector and to explain their gradual decline</p>

<p>There will never be "full employment" because people continually quit and are fired and because there is and will be a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills and ambitions (both aspirationally and monetarily) of people looking for work.  E.g., the need to "import" workers--often illicitly--into the U.S. to do jobs that those of us in the U.S. simply will not do, such as agricultural labor and domestic work.</p>
<p>To achieve "full employment," the government would have to require people to work for employers for whom they do not want to work or who pay poorly, and employers to hire and retain workers they do not want or need, or cannnot afford.</p>

<p>What about the effects that unions can have on the informational deficiencies in bargaining between corporations and individual workers? If I desire to put my capital to work, the government has provided me with a well regulate marketplace that allows e to make an informed decision as to the proper use of my capital and the risks and potential rewards associated with that use. Recognizing that there are huge problems with the way disclosure is handled in the capital markets (and the possibility of fraud). Nevertheless, the avowed "goal" is that every trade should be public so that an appropriate market price can be determined. </p>
<p>However, if I want a job, I am faced with the need to negotiate with a huge and powerful corporation. yes, there are informal ways to find out salaried, but there are absolutely no formal ways. I would doubt that anyone would describe it as a "goal" of our system that there should be full disclosure as to the true value of my labors. </p>
<p>Your "monopoly" talk about unions is completely outdated. It seems clear to me that they are no more a "monopoly" than the sole industrial company in a small town is a "monopoly." They mean to create certain inelasticities in demand but using the term "monopoly" is actually a way to "demonize" unions. </p>
<p>One could simply see them as attempting to regain the informational edge away from the monopsonostic    capital owners.  </p>

<p>Here in the UK the proportion of public sector employees has significantly expanded over the past decade, and their wages have risen faster than the private sector. </p>
<p>UK unions (which mainly function in the public sector) therefore remain powerful - especially at blocking market-orientated reforms of the public sector or attempts to remove restrictive practices (for example in education, health care, or the postal service). </p>

<p>In the "union era" of yesteryear, it was popular to view labor and management as being on opposite sides competing for shares of a pie.  This view treats corporate productivity as a constant and then permits workers to waste company resources trying to grab a larger share of those profits.</p>
<p>With the exception of Detroit (until now it seems) and the Airlines, modern industry appears to have escaped this conflicted relationship to their betterment.  Kudos to the CEOs who figured out how to lead companies in that direction - enjoy your well earned salaries.</p>

<p>I agree with most of Mr. Posner's and Becker's arguments, but assert that they're down-playing the risks of unionization. While unions have driven whole U.S. industries off the economic cliff, unionization in the public sector causes huge and long-lasting inefficiencies. While unions can ultimately drive companies bankrupt, the most likely effect of unionization in the public sector is to drive up taxes and to drive down the quality of services.</p>
<p>One particularly harmful union I wish they had addressed is the teacher's union. They have single-handedly blocked the most important kinds of reform that the nation needs in education, all to the benefit of inefficient public education institutions and their public employees. The price to be paid for their meddling is sky-high costs of education with poor results, which will ultimately drive American competitiveness into the ground. Talk of vouchers, privitization, school choice and pay-for-performance are all tabboo in this union-dominated profession. </p>

<div id="c091758">
<p>One reason for the decline in unions that I haven't seen addressed is that the NEED for unions has declined.  Companies will try to match union wages/benefits in the same or similar industry to prevent their employees from voting for a union.  Thus the THREAT of a union is actually more important than the union itself. Employees can obtain the benefit without being forced to pay dues.  Unions were formed so as to collectively bargain with the employer, on behalf of all the employees; the good of the many over the good of the few.  This has degenerated into protecting the individual worker at all costs, even when that might not be in the best interest of the many.  I worked in labor relations with major corporations for over 30 years (including over a decade with a Big Three automaker), but I'm not anti-union.  I believe that unions have lost their way; they've forgotten their purpose, and the result is that they simply don't appeal to workers like they used to.  They're seen as irrelevant and an impediment by most younger people.</p>

Me thought it were the other way around. Then upon further consideration it becomes apparant that an assumption has had to be made and that is that the wage always favors the top end of the labor pool and not the bottom or some spot in the middle. <br/>
A comment on labors' disenchantment with free trade is in order. I wager we both want the exact same things, being changes in the tax and regulation enviornments. Indeed the point of view is different but the wants of the union and their free trade "opposites" are the same. Unions call it a level playing field. Free traders call it free trade. Same difference. </p>

<p>Those poor poor workers who when faced with an organized buyer just can't figure out what wage to ask for...except that the labor market is very good at doing exactly that.</p>
<p>I see help wanted signs at sandwich shops which tell 8.25 / hour. I can look in the classified section. I can ask the factory "how much do you pay?" before I take the job.</p>
<p>And if truly workers were so dumb, why are most of them making more than the minimum wage? Those corporations must be idiots, too, not to just offer the minimum wage to workers who could never figure out they could make more.</p>

<p>Yes. Small businesses generally post the wage but I am talking about large corporations that have more pricing power. Ask yourself if they have signs outside the GM plants? Your anecdotal evidence does not really hold up when we are talking about market issues. It is a lot easier for me to sell my stock and move my capital than to change jobs.</p>

<p>Union membership has declined because the unions are seen as being for the union rather than for the worker.  The union which represents me called a strike in 2001.  The strike lasted for 40 days.  That was 40 days in which the union members and many of their sympathetic coworkers did not go into work and for which they received no pay.  Which gave the union a huge amount of clout with which to wring large concessions from management.  And what do you suppose was the huge concession?  Wages for the workers?  Increased health benefits?  Better retirement?  The union negotiators went for  the right to take union dues from all employees eligible for union membership.  Which is to say the union went for more money  for the union.  The union members and the employees got nothing, but after 40 days they couldn't really hold out much longer.  </p>

2) Uh, GeorgeNYC, you notice that even if GM doesn't post wage signs outside the plant, they still get far more job applicants than they can use- it's called the "labor market".  Just like the 400 people who were eager to apply at that terrible and repressive Wal-Mart the instant the doors were opened in Chicago.</p>
<p>My labor relations prof told us that we needed to learn and understand two things about unions, and armed with that knowledge, we would be ready for the economic world: a) a union is a political organization run by a politician; and b) a union is a business, and thus has the same goals as any other business- revenue growth, perks for management, power, etc.   </p>

<p>David and all:</p>
<p>Jack said: "There is another inherent flaw in capitalism; that is that the machine won't run "properly" at full employment. The reason? when demand is "too" high for working people the rascals will use that demand for their services to bid up their wages."</p>
<p>There are explanations other than the alleged evils of "capitalism" or the "anti-worker" stance of the Fed:</p>
<p>Answer:  My comment is a straight out plagiarism from most economic texts and I don't ascribe "evil" intent.  It's simply that capitalism is an engine and a powerful one that provides many benefits, but like diesel or gas engines and electric motors it requires external controls that increase efficiency or prevent them from overheating or running out of control.  It's not evil, it just is the case.</p>
<p>David sez<br/>
There will never be "full employment" because people continually quit and are fired and because there is and will be a mismatch between the needs of employers and the skills and ambitions (both aspirationally and monetarily) of people looking for work. E.g., the need to "import" workers--often illicitly--into the U.S. to do jobs that those of us in the U.S. simply will not do, such as agricultural labor and domestic work.</p>
<p>Answer:   You bring up some good points, however, the term "full employment" includes an allowance for those in transition.  Interestingly during the 90's boom the US operated at lower rates of unemployment, without generating inflation, than earlier economists (and Fed members) thought possible.  There are many possible reasons, some of which you mention: ie we were not really at full employment because a variety of means allowed   access to the nearly infinite supply of unemployed or underemployed of the world.  In fact one of the other "anti-worker" valves in DC is that of the number of H1B visas to allow when companies lament that they can not find enough techies...... at a given salary and we have NO idea how much product is delivered by glass fiber or wireless.</p>
<p>The overall result has been flat wages for those of median income and below which may make the $30 of the UAW and other auto builders seem high by contrast. But is it high? Let's take a look:</p>
<p>Since 1960 the dollar has wasted away to being about a tenth of the value it was then.  For example the 1960 Chev one could buy for under $3,000 is now just under $30,000.  Likewise a UAW employee of the era would have earned about $120/week instead of today's $1,200.  So nothing has changed, right?  </p>
<p>But what about the productivity gains? US industry has probably averaged 3% productivity gains in those years and in the auto biz the gains are likely much higher; thus the many fewer workmen building many more cars and trucks as mentioned.</p>
<p>If productivity gains averaged even 5% in the highly mechanized auto field that would be a doubling of output with the same number of employees in 15 years. From 1985 to 2000 there would have been another doubling.  </p>
<p>Thus, cars are assembled today using only a quarter of the man-hours that were used in 1960.  I've seen today's figure of 30 man-hours to assemble a car and suspect that it IS less than a fourth of the man-hours of 1960 for a labor cost per car of $1200.  Arguably, the company should be able to pay $4800 for assembly labor and still have the same  labor/selling price ratio they had in 1960, though some of that sum would have to go to the investment in robots, computers and other tech that enhanced the worker's productivity.  </p>
<p>Well the numbers are rough, but I'd bet not too far off (except for the health care mess) but the point is that labor costs are hardly "Detroit's"  number one problem and the question is, not only for the auto industry but for the US as a whole.......... who got the productivity gains?

<p>Kurmudge, good handle! </p>
<p>1) Jack is obviously a union organizer;</p>
<p>  ......... Well, No.  The role played by collective bargaining is covered in most economics texts and it puzzles me that Becker-Posner didn't  mention it.   Sometimes it seems "we" experience institutional forgetfulness or "those who know not our history are consigned to repeat it".  We are today at similar ratios of haves to have nots as was the case before the Great Depression and when union membership and the New Deal put Humpty Dumpty back together again.  Today, we seem, again, to have forgotten that supply w/o demand (and a buck to satisfy it) does not make a strong economy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) Uh, GeorgeNYC, you notice that even if GM doesn't post wage signs outside the plant, they still get far more job applicants than they can use- it's called the "labor market". Just like the 400 people who were eager to apply at that terrible and repressive Wal-Mart the instant the doors were opened in Chicago.</p>
<p>........ Bingo!!  Our system is a lifeboat for 100  sailors but only if 5 take turns being in the water.  Yes, it does always seem there are more job seekers than jobs....... while the Fed Chairman pontificates about "fighting inflation" and not "overheating the economy". Somehow, it appears that wage pressures at the bottom triggers great concern while those at the top are, somehow, not inflationary. </p>
<p><br/>
My labor relations prof told us that we needed to learn and understand two things about unions, and armed with that knowledge, we would be ready for the economic world: a) a union is a political organization run by a politician; and b) a union is a business, and thus has the same goals as any other business- revenue growth, perks for management, power, etc.</p>
<p>......... hmmmm, you didn't mention  "perks" for non-management, yet the term "company" connotes a group who come together to combine labor, capital and expertise for the mutual benefit of all. But perhaps you expect that to be handled by the union. After all for them to grow revenues they do have to offer and attractively priced product.   <br/>

<p><p>I am surprised that less mention was made of globalization as the culprit that has fed into the demise of unions.  Just as GM has loosened its reliance on Delphi and turned it's parts procurement into a global process, so have most financially responsible corporations increasingly searched abroad for the most cost-effective solutions to their problems.  Where an industry trends towards commoditization, that industry will be sourced to the lowest cost supplier.  Thus, while we are bemoaning the trade imbalance with China and with Asia in general, we are also moving our manufacturing and our skilled services to both China and India.  This is an inherent part of globalization, capitalism and free trade.  However, as jobs and industries migrate overseas, the leverage of unions rapidly turns into last ditch efforts to maintain industrial presence where it is increasingly less non-competitive.</p></p>

<p>When the big three or the airlines or trucking had some monopoly power unions were able to extract some of those monopoly profits for their members.  As the markets became more competitive the host companies could no longer support these monopoly wages.</p>
<p>In some cases unions can spur greater productivity.  Wages are a function of the marginal productivity of labor and the cost of capital.  If a union forces wages up, then the employer must increase the productivity of the workers or substitute capital.  </p>
<p>If you must pay higher wages for farm workers, the employer will take steps to increase the productivity of the workers and find substitutes for labor.  Of course the low productivity farm workers will be out of work.</p>

<p>Dan, I'm not sure that those industries had more monopoly powers at some other time, or that as a number of posters have suggested, the "monopoly power" is one of the perquisites for unionization. Coal miners? Retail clerks? Laborers? Carpenters? Cabaret and Hotel?</p>
<p>But in your second and third paragraphs you make the points that seem all but ignored today as the "wage race to the bottom" and devil-take-the-hindmost becomes almost our new religion.  I'd agree that higher wages and unionization have spurred labor saving technology to the benefit of us all.  Also, in those days when "a rising tide" did seem to lift all the boats, union negotiations brought some of the benefits of the increased productivity to the working folk.  Today, it's perhaps a mixed bag, but the Walmart, for one is a clear example of a leap in productivity with virtually none shared by  its labor force.  </p>
<p>Interestly (and ha! counter to our theory.) farming has not had unions nor has it offered many high paying jobs, but has enjoyed one of the highest rates of increased productivity over the last century of other sectors.  As you mention the "reward" for hard working farm hands is that of being laid off.</p>
<p>What do posters here think? Should working folk derive some direct benefit of increases in productivity? Or should those all accrue to upper management, owners and perhaps stockholders?  A part of the UAW flap today relates to deals made years ago when unions agreed to increased use of robotics, but insisted on some cushioning of the layoffs from the downsizing.  </p>
<p>A while back one of the airlines "downsized" and the arguably failed, CEO's golden chute more than set him up for life including membership in a very toney country club, while ticket agents who'd been with the company much longer than the CEO were dumped with two weeks of "severance pay".  Does this seem the mark of a decent civilization?   Jack</p>

<p>Quit lying. Productivity is up, but purchasing power and standard of living are DOWN. They have been going down since the 80s for "working people." Your personal experience of imperialist expansion is not universal. </p>
<p>"GM tried to replace people with robots because high wage union contracts blocked sensible more cost effective solutions."</p>
<p>  Yeah, like child labor or firing all old people.</p>
<p>"WalMart passes on the cost savings to customers."</p>
<p> And the lead paint too. But guess what, the customers are (or used to be) also SUPPLIERS to companies like WalMart. The cost savings come from offshoring labor, monopsony supplier contracts, and the lower regulatory costs of operating in overseas "free trade" zones. So instead of running my own toy shop I get to be a wage slave while some 7 year old child in Bangladesh paints toys with lead paint for 5 cents an hour. Then WalMart puts a yellow smiling rollback face on it and I feel empowered by buying it for a dollar less than I could have made and sold it for if I still had my shop. Yay, how efficient. Well met you kings of technocracy.</p>
<p>  Again, purchasing power and standard living are DOWN for nearly everyone. Lets be clear.</p>

<p>Workers would be more conservative in their strike actions if sonority did not exist. As it stands now a worker with many years with a company can be obstinate with a strike vote because he knows chances are even the company lays-off many workers, he won't be among them.</p>

aaaaaaaaaaaaa And has one of the fattest bottom lines in history.  They run these stores with VERY few staff relative to the amount of goods sold and would not be hurt by paying wages on par with what is paid by Costco.  (More?  What is the effect of having the profits pumped out of your town and stockpiled in Bentonville or the Cayman Islands? Can you run your town on the backs of $10 neighbors?)</p>

<p>aaaaaaaaaaaaa Overly simplistic and wrong. Please review the  interesting posts here. </p>
<p>Robotics have not worked well at GM. GM tried to replace people with robots because high wage union contracts blocked sensible more cost effective solutions.</p>
<p>aaaaaaaaaaaa Please document.  HOW have they gotten the number of man-hours per car down to 30? Why is downsizing the number of workers ALWAYS an issue for Detroit? Even they are building FAR more cars per year than in the past.</p>
<p>Working people do gain from high productivity, the increased purchasing power of their paycheck and a higher standard of living.</p>
<p>aaaaaaaaaa Well, AS DISCUSSED here, SOME gain from the higher productivity. Let's see, Detroit has had great gains in productivity and with unions, working guys are getting some piece of it while producing a car for about the same price (in terms of weeks worked to buy it) as in years past. </p>
<p>Walmart, to its credit is VERY productive and  yet, sans unions over a billion bucks of their labor costs are borne by tax payers via Earned income, subsidized housing, food stamps and other transfer programs designed for the poor. </p>
<p>Meanwhile farming and other industries have made great strides in productivity but, again, skilled  farm-hands are sent packing to join the ranks of "unskilled" job seekers. </p>
<p>Lastly, as Corey too seems to wonder: If we've averaged 3% in year over year productivity gains over the last 40 years where did the 200% plus in gains go?  While "to the consumer" might be an answer in electronics, it's surely not the case for cars, food, or other mfg goods.</p>

<p>Richard: Why would anyone be laid off after a strike?   Because the company doesn't want higher payroll costs if there is a wage increase?  </p>
<p>Does that mean that prior to the strike and raise the company was inefficiently allowing feather bedding? ie if it took a thousand employees before the strike to do the work, who will do the work after the strike?  If your answer is "more labor saving technology" I say GREAT!  as the jobs building automated equipment are typically more productive and pay higher than do the "lost" jobs of manual work.  </p>
<p>BTW I think that one of the most important things  for the US right now is a quantum leap in productivity or efficiency.  Despite all the talk of "info tech" it seems that most of our family budgets go to the traditional areas of housing, cars, medical care,  food, clothing and a bit of  travel and entertainment. Yet not many people are employed in these areas; what are the rest doing?  </p>

I will go slow since you seem to lack even the most basic understanding of economics.</p>
<p>The big three have some monopoly power that allows them to earn monopoly profits.  The UAW is able to extract some of these monopoly profits in labor contracts.</p>
<p>Competition increases in the auto industry.  The big three must find ways to increase the productivity of workers because the former monopoly profits are gone but they are still paying monopoly wages.</p>
<p>Consumers are being offered products that are safer, higher quality, more fuel efficient, etc.  </p>
<p>Wages are a function of the marginal productivity of labor and the cost of capital.  They are not just numbers that pop into an employers head.  </p>
<p>In order to pay the high labor costs that the new more competitive industry can no longer support, the big three must increase productivity, reduce unprofitable product lines, merge with other companies, or go out of business.</p>
<p>If the workers do not increase their productivity to come into balance with their wages, or accept wage reductions, the employer will reduce investments in the business and continue to operate as long as the prices they receive are above the average variable cost of production.  Once prices fall below that level the employer will stop production.</p>
<p>GM Robotics history has been very mixed.  I remember walking into a plant, not GM, but with a UAW workforce.  The first thing that you see is a robot that picks parts on command.  When an engineer asked me what I thought of it, I commented that it only made sense as an FU to the UAW.  I could have hired two people with a forklift to do the same job quicker and easier.</p>
<p>GM is full of such examples.  Machines that have a mixed record on things like installing windshields or tires.  And BTW, Toyota has historically used fewer robotics then GM.  Which company do you think is building better products on a consistent basis?</p>
