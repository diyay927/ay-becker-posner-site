			Posner shows there is no absolute distinction between rules
and discretion (and standards) because most sensible rules allow for discretion
in extraordinary cases. Yet there is a difference under less than extraordinary
circumstances, and rules are better in the great majority of circumstances when
they are feasible.
<p>One important advantage of regulatory rules partly stems
from the nature of human behavior. When the great majority of businessmen and
consumers are behaving in a particular way, such as the frenzied borrowing and
lending on housing and other assets that preceded the financial collapse, it is
extremely difficult for regulators to stick their necks out and shut down the
party. As a result, SEC and other bank regulators took no extensive actions to
rein in banks even though their asset to capital ratios had increased into
dangerous levels before the financial bubble burst. Both Fed heads Alan
Greenspan and Ben Bernanke in the early stage of the financial crisis said it
posed little threat to the real economy (of course, Bernanke later radically
changed his view).</p>
<p>Even when regulators can resist getting caught up in the
enthusiasms of the businesses and consumers that they are regulating, they are
still subject to enormous political pressures to go along with prevailing
behavior. Many companies and industries have full time lobbyists who spend
their time cultivating and trying to influence the officials who are regulating
their clients. Consumers are not as well organized, but they have votes, and
that makes regulators reluctant to take actions that reduce the availability of
credit or goods and services that consumers want. To take one of many examples, Congressmen and lobbyists put tremendous pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
to continue to take on risky subprime loans up to the collapse of the mortgage
market.</p>
<p>The pressure from interest groups on government officials
has long been noted. Simon Newcomb, a 19<sup>th</sup> century American astronomer
and economist, wrote in 1885, “One cent per year out of each inhabitant would
make an annual income of $500,000. By expending a fraction of {their} profit,
the proposers of policy A could make the country respond with appeals in their
favor…Thus year after year every man in public life would hear what would seem
to be the unanimous voice of public opinion on the side opposed to the public
interests”(Principles of Political Economy).</p>
<p>Rules set the tone for regulatory actions even though they
must allow for discretion under unusual circumstances. If bank regulators had a
rule requiring that the ratio of bank capital to bank assets had to be above a
specified threshold, they very likely would have been forced to take actions
that limited bank lending prior to the financial crash, even when they had
misgivings about these actions or when subject to political pressures to let
the financial party continue. This is why I favor such capital requirements,
and even steeper ones for the banks that are “too big to fail”.</p>
<p>If the Fed had been following a rule that made its intervention
dependent on some combination of inflation, output growth, and unemployment- as
in Taylor rules- it probably would not have intervened before the crisis hit
since all these measures were doing well. But a Fed following such a rule would
have intervened quickly after unemployment began to rise sharply and output
growth slowed dramatically.</p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act does require capital requirement rules for banks, and introduces other
rules as well. However, it offsets these good rules with various new
and dubious discretionary powers of regulators. These include the creation of a consumer
protection agency with potentially considerable power over consumer actions. It
also created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel drawn from the
Fed, SEC, and other government agencies, that monitors Wall Street’s largest
companies and other market participants in order to respond to what they assess
is excessive growth in the economy’s degree of systemic risk.</p>
<p>I am not arguing that rules alone are always sufficient to
guide regulators and other government officials. Clearly, at times rules have
to be supplemented to take account of circumstances that were not adequately
covered by the rules. Also rules have to be adjusted periodically over time as
new institutions and technologies develop, and as those being regulated devise
ways to get around the rules. In addition, regulators subject to rules may
manipulate the implementation of any rules. Nevertheless, we are likely to get
far better policies if we begin with a widespread set of rules that guide
officials, and then introduce discretion as supplements to this rule-based
system of regulations, rather than supplementing a basically discretionary
approach with some rules.</p>
