<p>The Senate immigration bill before the House of
Representatives is the most thorough overhaul of the approach to illegal
immigrants in a long time. That is a major step mainly in the right direction. The
bill also expands the number of skilled immigrants who can enter if they have
enough “points” in a new merit-based system for admitting 250,000 immigrants
annually. Although the bill on the whole should be applauded, it misses the
opportunity to truly ease the entry of legal immigrants.</p>
<p>The number admitted as temporary skilled immigrants under
the H-1B programs would be modestly increased from 65,000 a year to 115,000 per
year, and eventually up to a possible 180,000 per year. This program allows
companies to apply for particular skilled workers who can stay for three years,
with the possibility of renewing for another 3 years. The new upper limit is still considerably less than the number of skilled employees that companies want to have, and
it is even less than the numbers admitted during the boom years that preceded
the recession.</p>
<p>In addition to relaxing the H-1B quota, the Senate bill
introduces a new special quota that allows 25, 000 engineering and other
scientific graduates with advanced degrees from American universities to gain
admission annually. This is welcome, but it is a small number compared to the
annual number of foreign graduates in these fields, or to the ability of the
American economy to productively employ these graduates.</p>
<p>Skilled immigrants add a lot to the American economy not
only in high tech fields, but also in sectors throughout the economy. They
become entrepreneurs who employ other workers, they make scientific and other
discoveries, and they provide many other valuable skills wanted by companies. The
bill allows for the easy entry of entrepreneurs who want to start businesses in
the United States. That is only of modest value since while immigrants are more
likely to start businesses than the native born population, they usually do
this only after being here for a number of years.</p>
<p>The expansion in the number of skilled immigrants who can
enter under the point system and other provisions of the bill is definitely
welcome, but it still does not do justice to the large value added to the
American economy by skilled immigrants. The new quotas reflect not the demand
for skilled workers by the American economy, but the opposition of professional
associations of American skilled workers that want to limit the competition
from immigrants. </p>
<p>I have argued in previous blog posts (see, e.g., my discussion
on 11/14/2012) that the American economy can usefully employ many more skilled
workers than are allowed to enter under current law (or under the Senate’s
changes in the law).  This is why I have
proposed a very different approach to legal immigration that sells the right to
immigrate to anyone (aside from terrorists, etc.) who wants to immigrate (see
my “The Challenge of Immigration: A Radical Solution”, 2011). I show that skilled,
young, and ambitious workers would be the ones who most want to come when
immigrants must buy entry.</p>
<p>Most of the media discussion of the Senate bill revolves
around its treatment of illegal (i.e. undocumented) immigrants since these are
the most controversial provisions. The bill proposes a long overdue pathway to
citizenship for many of the estimated 11 million or so illegal immigrants
living in the United States. It requires them to have provisional status for at
least 13 years before they can apply for citizenship. One may not be happy
about giving favorable treatment to immigrants who came here illegally compared
to individuals who are waiting their turn to be admitted legally, but no one
can reasonably propose to send millions of illegal immigrants back to Mexico or
other countries.</p>
<p>To satisfy some of the Senate opposition to allowing illegal
residents to gain citizenship, the bill also proposes to make it much difficult
to gain access to this country from Mexico by crossing the border illegally. It
doubles the number of Border Patrol agents, and doubles the length of the pedestrian
fence along the border. </p>
<p>These steps to police further the borders with Mexico may be
politically necessary, but they are likely to be largely redundant because of
two major changes in Mexico that are reducing the supply of would-be immigrants
to the United States. One is the good economic performance of the Mexican
economy in recent years that increased the number of decent jobs there. The
second is the rapid decline in Mexican birth rates that is greatly reducing the
number of young Mexicans, the group most likely to try to cross the border
illegally. </p>
<p>If the Mexican economy continues to grow at a good clip,
which is likely for the foreseeable future, the number of immigrants that want
to come here illegally will be much lower than in the past. Although the
recession in the US is the major reason why illegal immigration has dried up
during the past 4 years, a contributing factor has been the decrease in the
desire of many Mexicans to come to this country illegally. That decreased
desire should continue, and even grow, during the next few years as the number
of young Mexicans continues to decline.</p>
<p>The Senate immigration bill is a major overhaul of America’s
policy toward illegal and immigrants. It also encourages legal immigration of
skilled workers, although it does not go far enough. And it is ironical that
the bill includes tough measures on border fences and border enforcement just when
the desire of Mexicans to immigrate is declining rapidly.</p>
