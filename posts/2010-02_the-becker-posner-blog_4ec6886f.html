<p class="MsoNormal">I believe that a Consumer Financial Protection Agency will
hurt rather than help consumers. Despite the claim that ignorance induced many
consumers with few resources to buy houses during the boom, consumers who
bought a house then with almost no down payment and low interest rates were not
displaying ignorance, but good sense. They put little of their own resources at
risk, and annual mortgage payments were cheap, especially in an environment
where housing prices were expected to continue to rise at a rapid rate.
Lenders, the Fed, and others who made these loans, or helped keep interest
rates low, made the mistakes and look foolish, not consumers who bought the
houses.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the vast majority of cases, consumers, even those with
little education, know their own interests far better than government officials
know them. Still, I have no objections to governments giving consumers information in
situations where information is difficult to acquire, as perhaps in the
restaurant food safety case cited by Posner. I can also accept putting
information about the harmful effects of cigarettes on cigarette packages,
although I doubt if that had much effect in reducing smoking.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Posner considers in most detail the issue of growing obesity
that continues a discussion we have had in this blog and elsewhere. Obesity in
the United States and other countries has been increasing for the past 30 years
due to much lower costs of calories, as in fast foods, and also due to more
sedentary activities, mainly due to the large amount of time spent watching
television, using the computer and Internet, and speaking on cell phones.
Giving consumers information about the adverse health consequences of obesity
might be a useful government activity, but Posner wants to go much further by
essentially taxing some of the sources of obesity, such as sodas and computer
games. I do not agree with him.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Posner supports aggressive actions against obesity partly
because he believes that consumer ignorance of the adverse consequences of
being obese helps explain its high rate of incidence. He cites the fact that
obesity is much more common among those with low income and low education.
People with low incomes and education differ in many respects from others, such
as their greater tendency to buy older used cars that are more likely to break
down. No one would suggest they do this out of ignorance rather than from the
constraints of low income. Similarly, fast foods, and fewer visits to health
clubs, would appeal to low income persons without any need to stress ignorance.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That ignorance is not the main factor in the high obesity
rates among low income and low educated persons is supported by the fact that
while the rate of obesity is much higher among African-American women than
among white women, it is not so much higher among African American men than
among white males. It is hard to believe that African-American men are much
better informed about the harmful effects of obesity than are African-American
women. This racial-gender difference in obesity rates is most likely related to
differences in the life situations of African-American men and women rather
than to differences in their knowledge of the health cost of obesity.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Posner’s second main argument for taxing obesity is that it
imposes an externality on taxpayers because they pay much of the higher cost of
medical care due to obesity. The most frequently cited study of the extra
medical spending due to obesity is by Finkelstein, et al. in the July 27, 2009
online issue of Health Affairs. It is a careful analysis of data for 2006 that
looks at the higher spending on medical care of the obese, after holding
constant income category, years of schooling, age, and many other variables.
Overall, the authors find that about 25% of the population is obese, and that
obesity increases medical spending by about 9%, which amounts to $147 billion
(in 2008 dollars).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They also find that private payers, not taxpayers under
Medicare and Medicaid, bear the majority of the additional medical costs due to
obesity. Since private insurance companies are not allowed to charge higher
premiums to the obese because that is considered discrimination, largely under
the Americans with Disabilities Act, the higher cost of obesity paid by
privately insured persons can hardly be called an “externality”, unless it is
considered an externality from government policy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If we take away more than half the total increase in medical
spending due to obesity because it is not borne by taxpayers, we are left with
a much more modest increase in health spending “externalities” due to obesity.
Even that smaller percent is too large because it neglects the “savings” due to
the fact that the obese die earlier than other persons. On this externality
logic, that saving should be subtracted to get a net “externality”. Some
analysts have even claimed that this net externality is negative, so that obese
people actually reduce taxpayer spending on medical care. If that were correct,
should we subsidize obesity?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have not accepted such externality arguments related to
medical care ever since several economists showed that smoking cuts down medical
(and retirement) spending because heavy smokers usually die early, and do not
collect much in the way of social security and Medicare benefits. Surely that
would be a foolish justification for subsidizing smoking. Yet the same logic
applies to attempts to justify taxes on obesity because of any medical costs
obesity imposes on taxpayers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Since even ignoring their earlier deaths, the obese raise
government medical spending by rather modest amounts, that “externality”
provides a weak case for taxing goods like soft drinks with sugar, fast foods,
and ice cream, or taxing computer games, watching television, and other
sedentary activities. As Posner recognizes, taxes on these types of foods and
time use activities would be a shot gun approach to reducing obesity since the
great majority of these foods and activities are consumed by men and women who
are of normal weight, or merely overweight (an earlier Rubenstein, et al study
does not find increased medical spending for men and women who are simply
overweight). Higher taxes on these items would cause a reduction in the
consumption of these items, and hence an unjustified loss in welfare, by the
75% of the population who are not obese.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To the extent that obesity imposes costs on others, it would
be far better to let private health insurers price coverage based on obesity
and related risk factors.<span>  </span>This
would target the desired group, and not impose inefficient costs on
non-obese persons by taxing the foods they eat or the activities they choose to
engage in.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Providing information about the negative health consequences
of obesity will do no harm, and might help prevent some persons from getting or
staying obese. Doing more than that, however, has little justification from
externality arguments, and hence is a weak basis for public policy.</p>
