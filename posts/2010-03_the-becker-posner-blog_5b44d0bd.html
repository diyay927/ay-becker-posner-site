<p class="MsoNormal">Although the American Constitution does not provide for the
filibuster, the founders of this country were very much concerned about
protecting the rights of minorities. The checks and balances between the
Congress, President, and Judiciary built into the Constitution were designed to
make it difficult to pass legislation that infringed on the rights of important
minorities. The Bill of Rights was added to the Constitution to solidify this
protection. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay in their
essays in the superb Federalist Papers argued for the Constitution against a
skeptical New York public. They recognized the necessity of having a
constitution that protected minorities from “ephemeral” majorities, and they
claimed the separation of powers, and other aspects of the Constitution, would
succeed in protecting most minorities. The founding fathers were not believers
in a naïve form of democracy where simple majorities should always have their
way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Posner gives a brief history of the evolution of the
filibuster rule in the Senate. The requirement that at least 60 senators, or
60% of the senate members, are needed to impose cloture and cut off debate is
not an overly stringent requirement for issues of any real significance. The
size of the supermajority needed to cut off debate is considerably smaller than
the Constitutional stipulated two-thirds majority required to overcome a
presidential veto of a bill sent from Congress. Surely, for example, a simple
majority should not be sufficient to commit a country to a major war, for that
could involve both a large sacrifice of the lives of men and women from
different regions and backgrounds, and much higher taxes and the creation of
large amounts of public debt, although I do not believe any senator has ever
tried to filibuster against US entry into a war.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several senators from the South in the 1950s tried to use
the filibuster to block civil rights legislation. Since for almost a century
after the Civil War the South had been preventing its sizable black population
from obtaining a decent education, good jobs, judicial protection, and common
decency, many in the North were outraged at this filibuster attempt to block
the provision of better education, voting rights, and other protections to
Southern blacks. Nevertheless, the civil rights legislation would require major
changes in the South, and it is not unreasonable that more than a simple majority
of Senate votes should have been necessary to implement these momentous (and also
highly desirable) changes. However, it should have been possible during the
1950s when Southern senators were filibustering to use a supermajority in the
Senate to invoke cloture to end the filibuster. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The many proposed changes in health care in the House and
Senate bills is the most controversial and important of all the current bills
working their way through Congress and President Obama’s agenda. Expenditures
on health care currently absorb 16% of American incomes, and this percentage
continues to grow. Since many of the changes in these health bills would have
large effects on taxpayers and patients, any major new health bill should be subject
to a possible filibuster that would require the votes of at least 60 senators to cut off
further debate.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The President has said that the debate has gone on long
enough, and that further prolonged debate on health reform would be useless. He
therefore proposes to use the “reconciliation” procedure to avoid any
filibuster and allow a health bill to be passed with a simple majority in the
Senate (and of course the House). I cannot say whether this is a wise political
maneuver, but I do believe the use of reconciliation in this case is harmful
from the point of view of the country’s welfare. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Despite the long debate, many provisions of both the House
and Senate bills remain highly controversial. These include, among many others,
the way the uninsured would get coverage, the de-emphasis on health savings accounts,
the postponement until 2018 of the elimination of the tax advantages from
expensive employer-based health plans, no increase in the ability of persons
and companies in one state to contract with insurance companies located in
other states, and especially the minor efforts to raise out of pocket expenses
by consumers of health care in order to reduce their overuse of doctors, drugs,
and even hospitals. Such a badly designed health care bill would on the whole
worsen rather than improve the American health care system, and it should not
be allowed to slip by through the back door of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So my conclusion is that the supermajority requirement of
invoking closure to cut off Senate debate is useful protection not only to
minorities, but also to overly hasty passage of controversial legislation.
People on all positions will sometimes be frustrated by the need to have such a
supermajority, but in the long run most of the time they will be happy that
such rules are in effect.</p>
