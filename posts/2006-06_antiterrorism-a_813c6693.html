<h3>Antiterrorism Allocations--Becker</h3>
<p>Posner discusses many of the thorny issues involved in the <br/>
allocation of funds by The Department of Homeland Security <br/>
to American cities to combat terrorism. I will concentrate <br/>
my comment on how to align the incentives of cities to those <br/>
of the country as a whole.</p>
<p>Posner points out that there is  a conflict between the <br/>
incentives of cities and those of the federal government. <br/>
When cities do more to prevent terrorism against their <br/>
residents and buildings, they also help the country fight <br/>
terrorism against other cities and towns without getting <br/>
compensated for that help. He also indicates that if the <br/>
federal government simply gives money to cities, the cities <br/>
may reduce the amounts they would otherwise spend fighting <br/>
terrorism. Both problems arise in many infrastructure and <br/>
entitlement programs, such as road-building, Medicare for <br/>
the poor, and the fight against contagious diseases.</p>
<p>These sources of the tendency for cities to underspend on <br/>
anti-terrorist activities can be at least partially overcome <br/>
if Homeland Security did not outright give various amounts <br/>
to different cities, but instead relied on the method used <br/>
to combat similar issues that arise with other grant <br/>
programs. The Department of Homeland Security should offer <br/>
to give cities a certain number of dollars for each dollar <br/>
they spend on antiterrorist activities. For example, if a <br/>
city spent $30 million, they might get an additional $60 <br/>
million from the federal government. In this example, a city <br/>
would get to spend $3 dollars for each dollar they used from <br/>
their own funds to fight terrorism.</p>
<p>Federal matching of this type discourages cities from <br/>
cutting back on their spending to fight terrorism since they <br/>
lose say $3 dollars for each dollar they cut back. Matching <br/>
grants also induce cities to give de facto recognition to <br/>
the fact that each dollar they spend helps residents of <br/>
other cities as well by improving the overall American fight <br/>
against terrorism. The ratio of federal spending to city <br/>
spending should be a measure of the ratio of the benefits to <br/>
other cities compared to the benefits to the city spending <br/>
their own money to fight terrorism.</p>
<p>The matching need not be independent of how cities spent <br/>
their own monies. Cities are more likely on their own to <br/>
spend on salaries than on capital goods that are produced <br/>
elsewhere since spending on employees gives jobs to local <br/>
residents. The matching grants should then be oriented <br/>
toward capital spending rather than labor spending. In fact, <br/>
the Homeland Security program is so oriented, and that seems <br/>
to me to make some sense.</p>
<p>However, matching grants, particularly if the ratio of <br/>
federal to local contributions is large, can create the <br/>
opposite problem from that created by outright grants; <br/>
namely, cities may spend too much since their spending is <br/>
multiplied through the amounts available in matching funds. <br/>
This is usually controlled by placing upper limits on the <br/>
amounts that could be received in matching funds. Cities <br/>
that are especially attractive to terrorist attacks--such as <br/>
New York and Washington--would spend more fighting terrorism <br/>
even without federal grants. Still, on their own they may <br/>
not spend enough, so the upper limits they could receive in <br/>
matching grants should exceed that available to say Kansas <br/>
City.</p>
<p>One problem is that as coastal cities like Los Angeles, San <br/>
Francisco, Boston, New York, and Washington became better <br/>
prepared to fight terrorism, terrorists might shift inland, <br/>
to places like Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, Omaha, Topeka, <br/>
and elsewhere. As the bombing in Oklahoma City showed, even <br/>
attacks in smaller cities cause considerable fear and <br/>
consternation. That is why a federal program has to be <br/>
national, and target smaller places as well as larger ones. <br/>
Matching grants encourage smaller cities also to contribute <br/>
to the fight against terrorism, and they will spend more <br/>
when they become more vulnerable after the more attractive <br/>
terrorist targets became better prepared. So the system is <br/>
partly self-correcting through the incentives that cities <br/>
have to protect their own citizens. </p>
<p>But matching grants do not solve all the problems of how to <br/>
best allocate limited federal funds. So the federal <br/>
government will still need some guidelines  that determine <br/>
which cities should be given more Homeland money, although <br/>
in a matched way.</p>

<p><br/>
The answer is easy. Give the most money to those cities in those districts and states where there is the greatest risk of a Republican incumbent losing in 2006 or a Republican challenger needs a boost to get over the top. That is likely on what the allocations are based.</p>

<p>Anti-terrorism allocations across states should be based on number of Muslims living in each state.  As an add-on special situations should be considered for extra allocations.  For example New York City should get a higher allocation for obvious reasons.  Home of Purdue University in Greater Lafayette, Indiana has a higher allocation caompared to towns of its size.  However given the threat level there, it should actually get more federal funding.  </p>

<p>Well, there is an answer.  Somewhat comforting.</p>
<p>Maybe the Bush Administration has *good reason* to not expect another attack?</p>
<p>Just a thought.  I mean, what if Bin Laden &amp; Friends were on ice somewhere... just waiting for Bush to need another Zarqawi Moment... or maybe there is no need for an attack.</p>
<p>Bin Laden has GOTTEN everything for which he asked.</p>
<p>you *do* remember he has a Master's in Economics... </p>
<p>I'd say, he got what he was seeking.  A financially crippled USA spending a fortune to hunt GHOSTS &amp; a freaked out Canada... </p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

<p><i>Anti-terrorism allocations across states should be based on number of Muslims living in each state.</i><p>If you believe the Republicans, then, rather than funding the solution to a problem directly, it's better to let the funding trickle down to a problem. For example, rather than funding schools directly it's better to give tax cuts to the wealthy and let the money trickle down to the schools - it's the classic multiplier effect.<p>What we need to do here, if you believe the Republicans, is exempt Muslims from paying taxes. That way, the money to fight terrorism will trickle down to the appropriate parts of the country along with a healthy multiplier effect to stimulate the economy in those areas most likely to be affected by terrorism.</p></p></p>

<p>"When cities do more to prevent terrorism against their residents and buildings, they also help the country fight terrorism against other cities and towns without getting compensated for that help"</p>
<p><br/>
Really? When I buy a car alarm and leave it blinking on my dashboard, I'm not helping in the country's fight against car theft. I'm just hoping that any potential car thief will decide that my car is too much trouble and go find a new target.  </p>
<p>Similarily, if New York turns itself into an impenetrable fortress, the terrorists plotting against it don't become accountants and graphic designers; they start looking at DC, Chicago and LA. For this reason, I think that the Feds should only be involved in security measures that reduce the total likelihood and expected severity of an attack, such as: bombing the bejesus out of hostile nations with WMD's in the makes; surveillance; Airport/coastal security.<br/>
