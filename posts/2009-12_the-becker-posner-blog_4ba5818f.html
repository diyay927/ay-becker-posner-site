Neither former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan nor the present
Chairman Ben Bernanke anticipated the financial crisis that erupted in 2008. In
addition, Greenspan helped keep interest rates low for several years after the
9/11 attacks on the United States that contributed to the boom in housing
prices, the stock market, and other asset prices. For these and other reasons
there is considerable anger and disappointment toward the Fed in Congress and
among some economists. 

<p class="MsoNormal"></p><p class="MsoNormal">This hostility explains the grilling that Bernanke received
this past Thursday in the hearings before the Senate Banking Committee on his
nomination for a second term as Chairman. It also explains the drive by many
members of Congress to have Congress exercise greater control over the Fed’s
behavior, and to take away from the Fed its power to supervise banks. As part
of this Congressional pressure, Republican Congressman Ron Paul of Texas has introduced a bill
to have the policies of the Fed audited by the Government Accountability Office
(GAO).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The problem with these attacks and proposals is not that the
Fed behaved perfectly either during or before the crisis-far from it- but
rather that closer Congressional supervision and oversight is likely to make
matters much worse rather than better. For example, although the Fed is
criticized for not foreseeing the financial crisis and for its low interest
rate policies, at the time there was no outcry in Congress against these
policies. In addition, few, if any, Congressmen warned that a financial crisis
would develop unless the Fed tightened up its supervision of banks, and also
raised interest rates. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Members of Congress also directly contributed to the
unsustainable housing boom. Barney Frank, one of the most knowledgeable Congressmen
about financial matters, urged banks to increase their mortgages to subprime
borrowers. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, extended further in 1995,
also basically forced banks to increase their mortgage lending to consumers in
poorer areas who were not likely to be in a financial position to meet their
mortgage payments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Fed clearly made some serious mistakes as it struggled
to cope with a financial crisis that was far more serious than Bernanke and
other members of its governing Board had anticipated. By not letting Bear
Sterns collapse, the Fed probably raised expectations that it would do the same
for Lehman Brothers and other major investment banks if they got into serious
trouble. All hell broke loose in financial markets when the Fed then let Lehman
go under.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>Perhaps too the
Fed should not have put so many resources into saving AIG, the major commercial
insurance company that also became a major insurer in the credit default swaps
market. Other decisions by the Fed can be legitimately questioned, but there is
little support for the view that the Fed would have behaved better if Congress
had been more closely supervising Fed policies. In any case, Congress already
has considerable supervisory powers over the Fed. This central bank has to
produce an annual report on its activities, and the Chairman must testify at
least twice a year before Congress. During this testimony, he has to explain
what actions the Fed has taken, and to justify them when questioned by members
of Congress. The minutes of the Board’s eight meetings each year are made
publicly available-with a lag- so that everyone can see what the members are
discussing, and any disagreements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Central Banks in many countries have fought over decades and
even centuries for the type of independence in their decision-making that the
Fed enjoys. The problem usually with dependent central banks is that they
engage in considerable inflationary printing of money under the urging of the
executive or legislative bodies that control them. The increased money supply
is an inflation tax, with the revenues used to finance greater government
spending that would not have been feasible with the income tax and other tax
revenue raised from companies and households.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The potential for inflation in a few years in the United
States is considerable because of the Fed’s extensive and unprecedented open
market operations as it tried to shore up the financial system. These
operations created over a trillion dollars of banks excess reserves. When the
upswing in the economy gains momentum, banks will use these reserves to lend
much more to companies and households, a process that will increase currency
and demand deposits, and thereby inflate prices. In order to subdue this
inflation, the Fed will have to sell many of the securities that it purchased
in open market operations, and find other ways to withdraw reserves and some of
the inflationary potential from the American banking system.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Such Fed actions will raise interest rates, and put downward
pressure on the economy’s growth, and contribute to increased
unemployment.<span>  </span>History shows that
such inflation-fighting actions are far less likely when central banks are not
independent, and legislative or executive branches control their policies. Even
the oversight that Congress already has over the Fed is likely to induce the
Fed to rein in its inflationary fighting policies. It would be an unpleasant
and ironic prospect if increased Congressional control of Fed policies led the
Fed to engage in more of the “easy” money policies that many members of
Congress are rightly criticizing this central bank for promoting during earlier
years of the decade.</p>
