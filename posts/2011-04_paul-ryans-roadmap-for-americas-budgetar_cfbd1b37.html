<p>The recent agreement between the Republican House leadership and President Obama to cut $38.5 billion from the federal budget during the rest of the year is a small step in the right direction of bringing federal spending under control. Since spending skyrocketed during past several years from about 20-22% of GDP to its present level of 25% of GDP, much more has to be done to bring federal spending back to its longer term share of GDP (for a way to approach this problem during next few years, see the Wall Street Journal April 4th op ed “Time for a Budget Game-Changer” by George Shultz, John Taylor, and myself).</p>
<p>A much bigger problem is presented by the expected growth in government spending on medical care and retirements during the next several decades. This growth is the main subject of Representative Paul Ryan’s recently released over 70 page “Roadmap” for entitlement control,and to a lesser extent tax reform. The report also includes cuts in defense spending and domestic discretionary spending that would help in taming the budget during the next half dozen years. Ryan's Roadmap is bold, creative, politically risky, and clearly highly controversial. On the whole, the Roadmap contains excellent proposals that, if enacted, would greatly improve the long-term budgetary situation of the federal government of the United States, and the long-run prospects for the American economy. I will briefly evaluate the main changes in health care spending.</p>
<p>1.     The Roadmap proposes to provide a $2300 health insurance tax credit for individual tax filers, and a $5700 tax credit for joint and family tax filers. This tax credit would substitute for the present tax exclusion of employer provided group health insurance from employees’ taxable income. This is quite close to a proposal made by Senator McCain during his campaign for president.</p>
<p>The present system of tying health insurance to employment through special tax advantages is both expensive and wasteful. It also discourages job turnover by employees because they have to obtain new coverage after changing employers or taking time off from work. Eliminating the tax exclusion of employer health coverage would break the artificial advantage given to employer health insurance compared to other group plans and to individual coverage. My main objection to the plan is that tax credits eliminate an important source of taxable income, so it would be better that the $2300 and $5700 government transfers be tax deductible rather than tax credits. Since individuals and families with low incomes and low marginal income tax rates would benefit little from a tax-deductible transfer, they should be helped through special provisions.</p>
<p>2.     The Roadmap would reform Medicaid for older recipients partly by substituting block grants to the states for the present system of matching state spending on Medicaid. This would force states to pay 100% of their expenditures in excess of their Medicaid grants rather than sharing these additional expenses with the federal government. The Roadmap would provide younger Medicaid recipients with health care debit cards that could be used only to purchase health care services and supplies. Families with incomes below 100% of the official poverty level would receive $5000 into their debit accounts (in addition to the proposed tax credit), while higher income families would receive smaller amounts. Both reforms of Medicaid are in the right direction because they introduce greater incentives to economize on medical spending by states, and by individuals and families on Medicaid.</p>
<p>3.     Medicare is the most rapidly growing entitlement program, and the most difficult to reform of all the entitlements. Unfortunately, to make it more politically acceptable, the reform proposed in the Roadmap will only start after 2021 when 55 year olds today will be 65. It would have been much preferable to have it start in five rather than ten years. Under the Ryan plan, seniors would no longer enroll in a government health care program, but instead they would buy health insurance from private insurance companies that would compete for their business. To help them do this, seniors would receive federal subsidies in amounts that would depend on their incomes. For example, couples with incomes below $160,000 would receive the full standard amount, whereas couple with incomes between $160,000 and $400,000 would receive only half the standard. The standard payment would be the average amount Medicare currently spends per beneficiary, adjusted for health risk, for inflation, and for increases in the medical cost index.</p>
<p> There are several advantages to these proposals for Medicare compared to the present system. Competition among insurance companies will increase efficiency in the delivery of medical care, and thereby keep costs down. The subsidies will help lower-income seniors afford decent medical coverage, but higher income seniors would have to pay more of their own money for insurance rather than taxpayers’ money. In addition, individuals and families could buy more expensive coverage beyond the basic plans financed by the proposed Medicare grants, but they have to pay for that additional coverage themselves. A major weakness of the American health care system is that out of pocket expenses are such a small percent of total medical spending. This proposal helps to correct that distortion.</p>
<p>The Roadmap has the potential to bring major savings as well as better care to the market for health care. I do not believe that the sizable growth in the fraction of GDP spent on health care in the United States (and also in other countries) has been a waste of money. Both the young and old attach very high value to improvements in the quality of their life, and in their life expectancy. However, substantial efficiencies are certainly available through proper reforms in the health delivery system.</p>
<p>Politicians have been afraid to touch medical care as they call it part of the “third rail” of politics, which would involve monkeying with benefits to the elderly. Representative Ryan and his committee deserve great credit for putting forward a bold and specific plan. It can be improved, but if the main parts were adopted, it would be a big help to reining in long term medical expenses.</p>
