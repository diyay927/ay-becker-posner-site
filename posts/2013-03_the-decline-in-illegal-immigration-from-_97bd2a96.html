<p>Net illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States has
been essentially zero and perhaps even negative, during the past few years. Is
this entirely due to depressed labor markets in the US and tougher border
policing, or have longer run forces also been at work? The answer is that
fundamental changes in Mexico have contributed to the immigration slowdown, and
these changes will continue into the future. As a result, the highly
controversial American political issue of what to do about illegal immigration should
become much less important in the future.</p>
<p>Immigration theory divides the factors determining
immigration into “push” and “pull” forces. Push forces refer to conditions in
the countries where immigrants come from, such as low incomes, high levels of
unemployment, restricted opportunities for children, and religious, racial, and
other forms of discrimination that make living there unattractive. Pull forces
refer to opportunities in receiving countries, such as good earnings, jobs, and
opportunities for children. Individuals migrate when the combination of push
and pull forces make the expected gains from moving large enough to overcome
the substantial difficulties of moving, including separation from parents,
siblings, and even spouses for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>In all major immigration episodes, younger adults do most of
the moving since they are less tied down by family responsibilities, and are
more willing to take on the various risks involved in moving to another
country. For many years, the net gain from moving to the US has been very high
to young Mexicans with modest skills and education. The main reason has been
much lower incomes in Mexico, even for persons with jobs, and jobs were more
available in America since Mexico has had highly restricted labor markets.
These forces encouraged millions of younger Mexicans to endure the uncertainties
and costs of crossing the border illegally.</p>
<p>The Great Recession put a temporary end to easy availability of jobs
in the United States since at the height of the recession the unemployment
rate of low-skilled workers ballooned to about 16 percent. The difficulties of
finding good jobs even encouraged some illegal immigrants to return to Mexico.
That, along with tighter border patrols, greatly reduced the number of illegal
border crossings.</p>
<p>Once the American economy resumes its long-term growth path
with full employment (it has not been on this path for the past 4 years), the
economic pull from the US should return to where it had been before the
economic crisis. However, the push from Mexico has been decreasing and should
continue its downward path for the foreseeable future. One important cause is
the sharp decline in Mexican birth rates during the past couple of decades. Not
long ago Mexico was a country with high birth rates that produced many young
adults who had trouble finding jobs. Now, the Mexican total fertility rate
(TFR)- the number of children born to a typical woman over her lifetime- has
plummeted to about 2.25. This rate is only a little above the population
replacement rate of 2.1. Unlike in the past, the number of young people in
Mexico will no longer be growing rapidly over time, so that the numbers looking for work in the Mexican labor market will be on the decline.</p>
<p>The push from Mexico has also diminished because its economy
has been growing at a good clip during the past 9 years. Excluding the large
drop in 2009, the growth rate in real GDP has been over 4% per year. Mexico’s growth rate after 2009 considerably exceeds
the American rate of under 2%, which is remarkable since about 80% of all
Mexican exports go to the depressed American economy. One consequence is that the gap
between earnings in Mexico and the United States is narrowing. This clearly
reduces the demand to immigrate to America, especially under the difficult
circumstances illegal immigrants face.</p>
<p>The US must find a way to offer a path to citizenship for
the millions of illegal immigrants in the country. I have suggested elsewhere (”The
Challenge of Immigration: A Radical Solution”, IEA, 2011) that the best
approach is to sell the right to immigrate. Since illegal, as well as legal,
immigrants could buy this right, such an approach would help solve the problem
of illegal immigration. </p>
<p>But even if no new policies are adopted to reduce the flow
of illegal immigrants, the number of new immigrants from Mexico will not return
to pre-recession levels because economic opportunities are rising in Mexico,
and there will be fewer young Mexicans who need to find jobs.</p>
