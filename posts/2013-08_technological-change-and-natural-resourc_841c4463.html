<p>Natural resource
prices increased rapidly during the first decade of this century, mainly
propelled by rapid increases in world GDP, especially of the US, China, Brazil,
and other fast developing countries. These prices then stabilized and many declined
due to the world recession brought on by the financial crisis in 2008.</p>
<p>Some examples illustrate the magnitude of the price movements.
Nominal copper prices quadrupled from 2001, despite a sharp fall in 2008, peaked
around 2010, and declined by about 25% since that peak. Oil prices increased from
$20 a barrel in 2002 to more than $140 a barrel in 2008, and have been in the range
$100-$120 since then. Natural gas prices in most of the world increased several
fold since 2000, and have been flat for the past couple of years. At the same
time, natural gas prices in the US have fallen by more than 2/3 since their
peak a few years ago.</p>
<p>These higher prices encouraged companies and
consumers to economize on resource use. In the short run, however, both the demand
and supply of oil and many other natural resources are only mildly responsive
to higher or lower prices. </p>
<p>The long run picture is very different, for then opportunities
to substitute away from the resources rising most in price are much greater
because users have more time to adjust. For example, more permanent higher
prices of gasoline induce consumers eventually to shift
toward smaller more fuel-efficient cars, and drive less with the cars they
have. They carpool more, make greater use of public transportation, or even take
jobs nearer their homes. Cars are smaller and more efficient in Europe and
Japan than in the US in good part because gasoline prices have been much lower
in US.</p>
<p>Longer run adjustments on the supply side are also much larger,
and some of them are game-changers. Although the world stocks of natural
resources in the ground cannot be augmented since they were created by millions
of years of evolution on the earth, the cost of getting these stocks out of the
ground vary enormously: from the cheap and easily accessible oil just below the
surface in Saudi Arabia to the difficult to access resources very far below
ocean surfaces. Higher prices of a natural resource encourage extraction of
more costly deposits, which increases the supply of that resource.</p>
<p>High prices also encourage investments in technologies to
lower the costs of accessing various deposits that make them worthwhile to
develop commercially. The most important example in recent years is the
improvement in fracking methods used to extract oil and natural gas hidden in
shale rocks. Wildcatters in the United States, like the recently deceased George
Mitchell, spent years and much money, sometimes assisted by government support,
in developing fracking to the point where it became commercially viable at the
oil and gas prices prevailing during recent decades.</p>
<p>The success of fracking has resulted in a huge increase in
American oil and especially natural gas production that greatly increased the American
supply of these fossil fuels to produce gasoline, substitute for coal in electric
power plants, and for many other purposes. Due to this revolutionary
technology, American oil imports are at their lowest level in more than a decade,
and natural gas prices in the US are now a fraction of what they are in Europe,
Japan, and other gas importing countries. </p>
<p>The price of oil in the US remains close to the world price
since oil continues to be imported. American oil commands the world price
because it competes against imported oil at that price. Natural gas prices differ
greatly among regions of the world because these prices depend on whether pipelines
and liquefied gas facilities allow gas to be imported or exported. As I
mentioned earlier, the widespread use of fracking techniques in the US has
produced a huge fall in the domestic price of gas in this country.</p>
<p>Of course, companies that extract natural gas from shale
would like to export some of their production to other countries to take
advantage of higher prices there. Since such exports would raise gas prices in
the US and lower them in the recipient countries, domestic users of cheap
natural gas have organized to oppose its export elsewhere. Restrictions on gas
exports would be unwise because the value received from the higher prices in
other countries would exceed the value created by the artificially induced
increase in American industrial output. It is poor policy to encourage domestic American industry
through costly and inefficient methods like export restrictions.</p>
