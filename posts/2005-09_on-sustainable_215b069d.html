<h3>On Sustainable Development-BECKER</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The very large increase in oil and natural gas prices in the past couple of years has led to renewed concern about whether world economic development is "sustainable". This term is typically not defined carefully, but sustainability requires that improvements in the living standards of the present generation should also be attainable by future generations. The concern is usually that because fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources are used to produce current economic development, future generations will have much greater difficulty in achieving equally high living standards. A related concern is that environmental damage due to global warming and other types of pollution will create major economic and some health problems for future generations.</p>
<p>In a simple arithmetical sense, the use of some non-renewable resources in current production clearly reduces the stock remaining for future generations. But the relevant concept for development purposes is not the physical supply of fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources, but the economic cost of gaining access to them. Over most of the past 100 years, fossil fuel prices relative to other prices declined rather than increased, even though significant amounts of these fuels were used to help develop many nations. The reason for the decline in relative prices is that new discoveries and better methods of getting at known sources of oil, gas, and coal led to growing rather than falling stocks of economically accessible reserves. </p>
<p>Exactly 140 years ago a great British economist, W. Stanley Jevons, argued (see The Coal Question, 1865) that the world was running out of coal, which he claimed in a few decades would make further economic progress impossible for England and other nations. The book is a high quality statistical study, but even Jevons failed to anticipate the use of oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, the discovery of additional sources of coal, and the extent of improvements in methods of extracting coal and other fuels from the ground.</p>
<p>Of course, what happened in the past is no certain guide to the future. But a 2005 study by Cambridge Economic Research Associates, a prestigious consulting company in the energy field, estimates that known reserves of liquid fuels (oil and gas) will continue to increase at least in the near term future, especially if the high prices of these fuels during the past year continue. Their report discusses the growing importance of drilling for oil in deep rather than shallow water, and other technological advances in extracting more cheaply the worldâs stock of oil and natural gas both under land and under water.</p>
<p>Even if one discounts this and other studies, and believes that the relevant reserves of fossil fuels will decline in the future, the supply of energy sources would greatly increase if nuclear power were more extensively used. That power too is based on a limited resource, uranium, but the supply of uranium is vast relative to its use in generating nuclear power. Nuclear power cannot only generate electricity, but it can also be used instead of oil or gas to produce the hydrogen used in hydrogen fuel cells. Although it is too early to tell, hydrogen cells could replace the internal combustion engine in cars, trucks, and busses sometime in the next few decades. Nuclear power would also help reduce greenhouse gases, such as CO2, and other types of pollution since it is a "clean" fuel (see the May 2005 discussion of nuclear power in our blog).</p>
<p>However, I believe that the most serious deficiency in the usually discussions of "sustainability" is that it should refer to total wellbeing, not simply to what is measured by national income statistics. Even if fossil fuels become increasingly scarce and expensive, and even with further declines in the environment, improvements in health will continue to advance overall measures of wellbeing. Life expectancy has grown enormously during the past half century in virtually all countries, including the poorest ones. Indeed, the typical length of life has generally grown faster in poorer than richer countries as they benefited from medical and other advances in health knowledge produced by the rich nations. The Aids epidemic has set back several African nations, but the increase in life expectancy has been impressive even in most of Africa.</p>
<p>A recent study (see Becker, Philipson, and Soares, "The Quantity and Quality of Life and the Evolution of World Inequalityâ" American Economic Review, March 2005) shows how to combine improvement in life expectancy with traditional measures of the growth in GDP to measure what we call the growth in "full" income. We demonstrate that the growth in full income since 1965 has been much faster than the growth in material income in essentially all countries, but especially in less developed nations. A better measure of full income that adjusts not only for the growth in life expectancy, but also for changes in the environment, and for the great advance in the mental and physical health of those living, especially of the elderly, almost surely grew at an even faster rate.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely that the pace of medical progress will slow down in the coming decades. Indeed, I believe just the opposite is true, that medical progress is likely to accelerate.  My belief is based on the magnificent advances in knowledge of the genetic structure of humans and other mammals, and the development of biomarkers, such as the PSA test for prostate cancer, and the blood test for BRAC 1 and BRAC2 gene mutations that greatly raise the risk of breast cancer. Experts on mortality are predicting huge increases during the next 50 years in the number of people who live beyond seventy, eighty, and even ninety in reasonably good health. </p>
<p>Slowing down and reversing global warming may require reductions in the world's use of fossil fuels, and economically relevant reserves of non-renewable resources could decline in the future rather than increase. These forces combined might lower GDP per capita in many countries-although I doubt it- but progress in medical knowledge will produce substantial advances in the world's full income. So just as the per capita wellbeing of present generations is much higher than that of our parents and grandparents, so the wellbeing of the generations of our children and grandchildren are very likely to be much higher than ours (setting aside the damage from possible highly destructive wars and terrorism).</p>
<p>This is why I believe that while the sustainable development literature asks important questions, the analysis has been inadequate and overly alarmist. Most of the discussion takes a mechanical view of changes in the stock of the stock of non-renewable resources, pays insufficient attention to technological advances in the economy, and gives much too little weight to the enormous advances in health that are highly likely to continue in the future, and possibly even accelerate.</p>

<p>I agree to your view. Just one point not directly related to the discussion: I believe the report you are referring to is from Cambridge "Energy" Research Associates (i.e. not "Economic").</p>

<p>What's interesting about Jevons' The Coal Question, is that the concern arose because of the increased efficiency of steam engines (thanks to James Watt).  <br/>

<p>Just a few calcs for nuclear power replacing oil:</p>
<p>The U.S. uses about 21 million bbls (blue barrels) of oil a day.<br/>
18 million of those barrels goes into gasoline production.</p>
<p>At 100% efficiency, the U.S. would have to build 1200 new nuclear plants to replace the amount of energy those 18 million barrels represent. Due to the production and transmission losses inherent in electrical power, we would actually have to build around 5000 nuclear plants to replace the oil we burn powering cars and trucks...that's 100 new nuclear plants per state.  </p>
<p>Each nuclear plant costs about $5 billion to build, so figure about $25 trillion + all the new transmission lines, gas station modifications, waste storage, etc... call it $50 trillion.</p>
<p>There are only 441 nuclear plants operating worldwide today...109 in the U.S.</p>

<p>"This term is typically not defined carefully, but sustainability requires that improvements in the living standards of the present generation should also be attainable by future generations."</p>
<p>I take it Dr. Becker that your more "careful" definition assumes maintaining the present world  status quo where 1/10th of the world's population consumes most of the fossil fuels. </p>
<p>How about calculating "sustainability" using an economic model where the rest of the world gulps fossil fuels on the scale of the USA to enjoy the same kind of living standards and not just better health and "full income".</p>
<p>Also, please visit the countries in the sahel region of Africa to see the impact of environmental change on people's very basic livelihoods. It gives a very graphic meaning to the whole issue of economic sustainability.</p>

<p>What I find to be really at issue, is that certain suppliers, i.e. Saudi Arabia, believe that they will always control the 'supply.'  There's no use describing what the supply really is, we don't know.  Most likely there's more than we would ever pessimistically predict, people are very concerned about saving their lives, and when it becomes critical, then people stop whining and start working.(or start intimidating, for real)  Oil could be 'fools gold' so I really worry that Americans are being deceived and that this is a form of 'taunting' when frankly, America is a giant already.  </p>
<p>I think the best thing to do is to look for alternative solutions and to try to manage it so that we're not so intimidated by foreign bogeymen who will suddenly make us all sink into anarchy.  Really, it can't happen, parasites would be too stupid to kill of their host, they're greedy so they're not mad.  </p>

<p>It's interesting that both Becker and Posner address this question assuming "other things are equal":  in other words, that no major series of natural catastrophes, epidemics, or wars significantly influences what kinds of economic development are "sustainable" and which are not.</p>
<p>There have been eras -- such as the last 50-odd years, and the last half of the 19th century -- when this assumption was mostly well founded.  It could be in the next 50 years as well.  But maybe not.  Rapid, even spectacular advances in medical knowledge and technology may do great good for some people, but a major flu pandemic could kill millions of the people medical advances could have helped.  Demographic "bubbles" (an abnormally large number of old people, for instance, or poor people) could be deflated by the same mechanism.  A nuclear exchange or even a major accident somewhere in the world, internal political turmoil in China or India or protracted warfare in the Persian Gulf region, unforeseen technological breakthroughs and perhaps other major events could significantly alter our ideas about sustainability, as did the momentous events of the last century's first half.</p>

<p>I am reminded of Einstein a hundred years ago. In 1905 he published major discoveries in the fields of quantum physics (the photoelectric effect), statistical mechanics (brownian motion) and relativity (magnetism and special relativity). I don't know whether he felt good about the coming century or not but many people in his position would have been feeling rather optimistic.<p>I wonder if Einstien had any idea that a decade later Europe would be plunged into WWI and a couple decades after that the fighting would resume with WWII and that in the process he and other members of his ethnic group would be driven out of Europe (if they were lucky enough to find a country willing to take them) or killed (if they weren't).<p>In 2005 it is easy to look at recent scientific progress and feel optimistic about the coming century but there's no guarantee that this century won't unfold the same way as the last one.</p></p></p>

<p>It seems to me that Becker's analysis can be summarized as follows:  lots of bad things may happen because of lack of sustainability in the energy industry, but it doesn't matter because medicine will advance so much that our overall happiness will increase anyway.  That seems to be a very silly way to analyze a situation.  It suggests that we should stop working on one set of problems just because there will likely be progress somewhere else.  Instead, we should work on all of our problems.  There are enough people to do that, but it won't happen if we gloss over the problems.  Perhaps I'm overly optimistic, but I believe we can clean up the environment, improve people's health, reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, AND address the problem of inequality around the globe.  We shouldn't pick only one problem to work on.</p>

<p>Wes,</p>
<p>I think there is cause for greater optimism in this century than the last, because a number of factors relevant to war are different now.</p>
<p>The world is much more interconnected by trade, aid, communications and political connections, than 100 years ago. Multiple overlapping economic and political coalitions now exist. These connections raise the cost of going to war.</p>
<p>The rise of information as a good has weakened the connection between economic power and geography. The death of mercantilism has essentially broken the connection between natural resources and wealth.</p>
<p>The development of mass communications and media has made it more difficult to secretly mobilize for war, and to incite or sustain human atrocities (true, atrocities still occur but I suspect they occur less frequently and when they do they are smaller - I can't prove this).</p>
<p>Also, the lessons of last century, in particular the contrasting outcomes after the first and second world wars (Versailles vs Marshall Plan) remain relevant and are unlikely to be forgotten.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I think it is unlikely we will see another world war this century.</p>
<p>An area that is of concern is that as nuclear technology is more widely disseminated there is an increased likelihood that either a) an accidental detonation, or b) a terrorist gaining access to a nuclear weapon. This is, of course, a different kind of problem to that faced a century ago.</p>
<p>I'm no historian but I believe Einstein could have predicted a European war in 1905 or shortly after. Having read a history of the early 20th century I was struck by the political volatility that existed in Europe 90-100 years ago, and the contrast with the cordial relations of today.</p>

<p>I don't think he ever suggested that it wouldn't matter or that we should quit working on one problem just because there might be offsetting gains in another area. Obviously, working on both problems would maximize utility, to use the economics lexicon.</p>

<p><i>I'm no historian but I believe Einstein could have predicted a European war in 1905 or shortly after.</i><p>Whether he could have predicted it, he did manage to find a way to live through it. That may be the most important lesson: that people manage to live their lives in spite of the wars that occur in their lifetime. Then again, the people who don't live through the wars aren't around to talk about it so the fact that people who are around to talk about it have lived through wars may not actually mean very much.<p><i>Having read a history of the early 20th century I was struck by the political volatility that existed in Europe 90-100 years ago, and the contrast with the cordial relations of today.</i><p>My, admittedly limited, understanding of WWI is that the root cause was jockeying for power and influence. This led to a situation where no one felt they could back down and they all jumped into what was supposed to be a minor war (over the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand) in order to "defend" their interests.<p>It's interesting that Bush recently said "The terrorists concluded that we lacked the courage and character to defend ourselves, and so they attacked us," The statement lacks any precise interpretation but the general feeling it conveys is similar to the attitude of the main players in World War I just prior to World War I - that bad things will happen if a country doesn't go to war at the first opportunity.<p>I didn't trust Clinton to keep his personal life in order (and I didn't care if he didn't) but I did trust Clinton not to start World War III. I'm not sure I can say the same about Bush and the leaders who follow in his footsteps.</p></p></p></p></p></p>
