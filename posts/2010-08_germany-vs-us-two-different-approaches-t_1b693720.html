<p class="MsoNormal">In many past commentaries I attacked labor markets in
Western Europe as being too rigid regarding layoffs and hires, and for providing too generous unemployment compensation often for very extended periods. That
rigidity explained why unemployment rates in the 1990s and the first 6-7 years
of this decade were much higher there than in the United States. Responding to
the facts of high unemployment and long durations of unemployment, and to criticisms
of their labor market policies voiced by economists, many countries of Western
Europe began to reform their labor market policies to make them more flexible,
and to limit the duration of government support of unemployed workers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The case of Germany is one of the most interesting, only
partly because Germany is the largest economy of Europe. Under the long reign
by the conservative Christian Democratic Union, little was done to reform the
German labor market. In a reminder again of the “Nixon going to China”
doctrine, the socialistic Social Democrats, led by Gerhard Schroder, introduced
various labor market reforms in 2003 after being elected to power in 1998. He
cut the length of the period of eligibility for unemployment compensation,
extended the age of retirement and reduced retirement pensions, and made it a
little easier for companies to layoff workers. In good part as a result of
these policies, while Germany unemployment had been close to 10%, it fell to 7.5% prior to the onset of the recession, perhaps mainly due to these
reforms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Germany was hit hard by the worldwide great recession as world
GDP took a nosedive, mainly because Germany is the world’s second largest
exporter after China. Its GDP fell by over 5 percentage points in 2009, and is
expected to rise by about 2% this year as world GDP recovers, and because the
euro has fallen by about 10% relative to the dollar since the euro peaked at
about $1.5 per euro. The German economy as measured by GDP was during the first
quarter of 2010 still somewhat below comparable numbers for the first quarter
of 2008.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What happened to German employment and unemployment is even
more interesting. Employment fell only slightly, but part time work increased
sharply as jobs were spread. Unemployment rates increased only a little.
Unemployment is now down to its 7.5% pre crisis level, and employment is back
at its earlier peak, and part time work is declining, as the German economy
continues to recover.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Contrast this with the American economy. On the one hand,
the US financial system was hit much harder than the German system. On the
other hand, the German economy is far more dependent on exports than is the
American economy. The net effect of these differences is not completely clear,
although US GDP fell by a lot during the first year after the recession hit,
but then began to recover at a moderate rate. Whereas Germany’s unemployment
rate grew by very little during the recession, the US unemployment rate grew by
over 5 percentage points. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This difference in employment and unemployment behavior
between Germany and the US may be mainly the result of the fact that the
American labor market is still far more flexible in most respects than the
German labor market. However, if that were the main explanation, then the jobs
recovery in Germany should have been slower than in the US, but that has not
been the case. Total jobs in Germany are about at their pre-crisis level,
whereas the number of Americans employed is still several million below its
peak in 2008.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Germany was criticized because it did not have a big enough
stimulus and did not run large enough fiscal deficits to stimulate the
economy.<span>  </span>In early 2009, Germany
introduced a 50 billion euro stimulus package after much urging from
intellectuals and some economists. That is about 1.6% of its GDP, with about
one-third earmarked for infrastructure improvements, and the other two thirds
going to tax cuts, child allowances, and social benefits. Even more important
from the traditional “stimulus” analysis, Germany’s fiscal deficit is expected
to hit between 5-6% in 2010, smaller than the fiscal deficits in many euro-zone
countries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Contrast these numbers with those for the United States. The
American stimulus package of about $800 billion-by no means as yet all spent-
is 6% of American GDP, about four times as large relative to GDP as the German
stimulus. Even more telling is that the fiscal deficit during 2009 and expected
during 2010 amount to about 12% of American GDP, far larger than the fiscal deficits
Germany has been running. Germany has recently taken actions to cut spending
and raise some taxes, while the US government continues to think of ways to
increase government spending, as if the huge fiscal deficit is not enough.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Let it be clear that I am not claiming that US employment
and unemployment has been very sluggish in recovering to pre crisis levels
mainly because the US has had a large stimulus package and large fiscal
deficits. They probably have been factors, but the evidence is still too
uncertain to reach such a judgment. But it is clear that the stimulus package
completely failed relative to the explicit predictions of the Obama
administration and its Council of Economic Advisers about what would happen to
unemployment. They predicted unemployment would decline by about 1.5 percentage
points from a much lower peak, whereas so far the total decline from the higher unemployment peak of 10.2% is only 0.7
percentage points.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I continue to believe that the biggest factor in the
sluggish employment recovery of the US is that many of the actual new and
proposed anti-business legislation, as well as the large fiscal deficits, made
businessmen and investors cautious about taking on new workers. These proposals and laws include
the health care bill, the pro-union bias and anti-business rhetoric of Congress
and the president, suggested increased taxes on higher earners, changes in
anti-trust laws to be less pro-consumer, and the endlessly complicated and
largely misplaced financial “reform” law. Germany, by contrast, has continued
with the same coalition government headed by the mainly pro-investment, pro trade
Christian Democrats. Germany surely made various mistakes during this recession,
but the US has made many more.</p>
