<h3>The Cash for Clunkers Program: A Bad Idea at the Wrong Time-Becker</h3>
<p><br/>
The cash-for-clunkers program of the federal government began in late July, and will end this evening. It provides a credit of from $3500-$4500 for anyone who trades in an older car to buy a new fuel-efficient car. When measured by its popularity, this has been a highly successful program, for about 500,000 applications have been submitted under the program during these few weeks. The strong demand caught the government by surprise, so that it had to add a couple of billion dollars to the one billion dollars initially allocated to the program. Officials are far behind in the paperwork required to compensate dealers for the cars bought under the program. <br/>
Unfortunately, that the subsidies are popular is no measure of its public value, and I am afraid there is little to be said at any level in defense of a cash-for-clunkers program. Hundreds of thousands new cars will be purchased under the program, but many of these purchases would have occurred later in 2009 or in 2010 instead of during the five week window of the clunkers program. There is little value to the economy in subsidizing consumers to buy cars a few months earlier than they would have bought them anyway.</p>
<p>To be sure, some cars would be purchased under the program that would not have occurred during the next 18 months, if at all. But if the goal of the program is to help stimulate the economy by subsidizing consumer spending, why limit it to individuals who own old cars? Why not give vouchers to all consumers that they can spend for a limited time period on many durable goods, such as computers, printers, TV sets, washing machines, and refrigerators? If that seems like too obvious a straight handout, the government could require consumers to turn in old computers or other durable goods in exchange for new ones. Of course, as with the cash-for car clunkers subsidy, many consumers under this more general clunker program would simply alter when they purchased the new durables to take advantage of the subsidy. The net result would again be subsidies that produced little net increase in spending.</p>
<p>Several arguments might explain why the decision was made to concentrate the clunkers program on cars rather than include other consumer goods. A cynical view is based on the fact that the federal government is now a major stockholder of two auto companies, GM and Chrysler. Subsidies to stimulate the demand for cars raises the sales and profitability of these companies, which would help justify the Obama administration's decision to bail out these companies in a big way. Of course, the longer-term effect on GM's and Chrysler's profits would be small if the cash-for-clunkers program mainly redistributed new car purchases from later times into these past five weeks. That the government wants its car ownership balance sheet to look better does not mean that the program makes good economic sense.</p>
<p>Another justification for the program relates to the environment, and argues that carbon dioxide and other pollutants from burning gasoline would be reduced if new fuel-efficient cars replaced old inefficient cars. However, the exchange of clunkers for new cars would raise, not lower, the amount of gasoline consumed to the extent that consumers traded in old cars that they never or seldom drove because the cars were in such bad shape for nice new cars that they would drive a lot. <br/>
Even if the older cars were in reasonably good shape but got poor gas mileage, new cars would be driven more miles because, being much more fuel efficient, they would use much less gasoline per mile of driving. On balance, the clunker exchange might result in only a small net reduction, if any, in the amount of gasoline used. According to Sunday's New York Times, the average trade-in got 15.8 miles to the gallon compared to about 25 miles per gallon for the cars that were purchased. If the cars will be driven about 50% more miles per year than the clunkers that were exchanged-not an extreme assumption- there would be essentially no effect on the gasoline consumed.<br/>
The main problem I have with the cash-for-clunkers program from the viewpoint of reducing pollution is that the program is such an inefficient way to cut down on gasoline consumption. The obvious best approach, not politically easy to accomplish, would be to raise the federal tax on gasoline. This would encourage owners of all cars to drive fewer miles since the cost of driving would go up for every driver, no matter how fuel-efficient their cars were. Higher gas taxes would especially encourage owners of older inefficient cars to drive much less-as they did when gas prices topped $4 per gallon- and even induce them to trade in their old cars for more efficient cars without offering any special incentives to do so. This criticism of the clunkers program as inferior to a gas tax applies also to the CAFÃ standards approach of the US to raise the miles per gallon of gasoline of the fleet of new cars produced, the cash and tax credit incentives to buy hybrids, and various other approaches that are being used to try to reduce gasoline use.</p>
<p>There is a further major difficulty with the clunkers program that illustrates a much more general problem of fiscal efforts to stimulate the economy. The details of spending programs are so slow for legislators to work out, and the delays in implementing the spending are so long, that the government "stimulus" gets implemented usually only after the economy is already pulling out of a recession. The US economy and that of most other major nations have stopped declining and are beginning to grow again. Yet rather little of the Obama stimulus package has yet been spent. </p>
<p>As Posner indicates, most of this spending has taken the form of transfer payments, but that is for a good reason since government projects are much slower to develop and implement. Even payments to car dealers under the clunkers program are being delayed because of administrative snafus in processing claims. This is a classical argument against using government spending for counter cyclical purposes, but seems to have been forgotten during this recession.<br/>

<p>Can you guys say, "Feel Good Politics"?  Throw Joe Sixpack a bone?  How about a handsome transition allowance for auto dealers wrestling with a deep recession, unsold '09 inventories, the GM and Chrysler BKs, tightening consumer credit, and a veil of mystery about what the new vehicle lineups will look like when 35 mpg kicks in?  If there's any public policy defensibility about the "clunkers" program it'd have to be that it did succeed in removing a few hundred thousand worn-out, gas-hog, poor-emissions, and probably dangerous cars and trucks from the roadways.  It isn't unreasonable to argue that real lives and limbs saved are worth more than Wall St bankers' bonuses.  And some will be saved.</p>
<p>A popular rumor holds that our old household appliances will be next.  Another sez the TARP and similar program $$$ held back and being repaid is already earmarked to take the Too-Big-to-Fail banks off their $ Multi-Billions in bad commercial real estate exposures.  And the FDIC, of course, needs $ Hundreds of Billions if it's going to close 200 more regional &amp; local banks and protect depositors to $250K per depositor per institution.  Congress giveth and Congress taketh away.  It just waits to drop the other shoe.  All considered, it's a miracle we're still on this side of the grass.</p>

<p>Becker and Posner persuasively explain why the Cash For Clunkers program is idiotic public policy.  To be sure, however, the Cash For Clunkers idea has some symbolic value.  Why not combine that symbolic aspect of Cash For Clunkers with government spending of taxpayer money in furtherance of a truly worthy aim?  That is, apply Cash For Clunkers principles to send Pelosi and Waxman and their legislative allies to the political junkyard.<br/>

<p>Professor Becker,</p>
<p>I agree that the program was inefficient and probably had only mediocre effects on the economy or the environment. However, it may have been one of the only politically feasible way to start some long-term environmental benefits.</p>
<p>For instance, the average participant would have to drive the new car 58% more miles to match the CO2 output of the clunker (not to mention the other pollutants, which are probably much worse for the clunker). I suspect the increase will be much smaller than that. Also, combined with higher gas prices, this program could be a good way to get lower-wage Americans into more efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the program rewarded drivers who have been polluting the most, instead of those of us who have always driven fuel-efficient cars. However, the world is not fair, and this programs seems like a practical way to reduce emissions.</p>
<p>(Maybe if more Americans were happy to have their government tax gasoline and internalize the negative externalities associated with driving, Obama could have pursued a more efficient program!)</p>

<p>The Cash for clunkers program from what I've seen was intended to provide a two pronged solution to two major American problems. The first is environmental. Such that the U.S. has International obligations to reduce its carbon emissions, this is accomplished by removing old worn out transportation vehicles from the roads which are one of the largest producers of the Nation's Carbon footprint. This it has done to a certain extent. </p>
<p>The second prong of the program, was stimulating the Economy. All Auto Manufacturers have been suffering from massive cash flow problems, due to the collapese or near collapse of the over leveraged Financial Industry. Such that the existing inventories of Auto Manufactures have become a significant drain on their assets which are required to weather this economic storm. By creating the "Cash for clunkers" program, Congress ahs created an artificial demand for this unused and econmically damaging excessive inventory. Reducing it to a level, whereby the Auto Industry is not being dragged down by an Inventory millstone around it's neck along with a  lack of internal cash flow via non available loans from the Financial Industry. Also, by reducing Inventroy levels, It also sets up the Auto Industry and its suppliers, for a quicker recovery when sales begin to creep up naturally with the rest of the recovery of the Economy by replacing depleted inventories. So from this pespective, the "Cash for Clunkers" Program may very well be a success. Let's hope so.</p>
<p>"The times are piled high with difficulties and we must rise with the occasion, so we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves and then we shall save our Country." </p>
<p>We need and must put people back to work in paying, full time jobs, with benefits. That is the only solution to the Economic Crisis.       </p>

<p>There seems to be a problem with the logic here.  Even if it's true that the newer cars are driven more miles, there is no reason to believe that the number of cars on the road will increase as a result of the average car being driven more miles.  For example, cars might be bought less often.  And if the total number of cars on the road stays the same, then the increase in fuel efficiency is still beneficial.</p>
<p>Assuming the amount of fuel consumed per day does decrease as a result of the program, it's worth pointing out also how hard it would be to reproduce the same result again.  In order to save the same amount of fuel again, the same number of 25 MPG cars would have to be traded in for 57 MPG cars.</p>
<p>Regardless of its other merits or demerits, I think the program counts as a modest success for the environment.</p>

<p>GM and Chrysler are so bad.  It doesn't matter how many billions the govt. gives to the UAW to reward them for voting for Obama, nobody wants the garbage they make at the prices they charge.

<p>The linchpin here is his estimate that new cars will be driven, on average, 50% more miles than old cars.  Is there any justification for this assertion that mileage demand is so elastic?  Is it based on the reduction in driving last summer?  Poll data showing that many clunkers were never driven at all?  Help me out.</p>

<p>Becker: On balance, the clunker exchange might result in only a small net reduction, if any, in the amount of gasoline used.</p>
<p>Anon:Regardless of its other merits or demerits, I think the program counts as a modest success for the environment.</p>
<p><br/>
Both Becker and Anonymous (and most people) miss one crucial fact here.  The difference between the two cars MPG is NOT the only relevant use of gasoline (I'll say "oil")-- there is also the one-time but very substantial use of oil involved in MANUFACTURING A NEW CAR!!!</p>
<p>Good grief, people.</p>
<p>Petroleum distillates are involved in almost every single aspect of manufacturing a new car, from direct use (in every plastic), to nearly every indirect aspect, like trucking the finished car to the dealer, like getting ten bazillion workers to their respective factories/offices, like keeping all the various machinery "oiled", ad infinitum.</p>
<p>In all probability, the total oil consumed by the "trade-in" guy is an order of magnitude greater than the guy who sticks with his old clunker, the difference in MPG notwithstanding.  And that goes for *every* do-gooder who junks an old car to buy a Prius, regardless of the Cash For Clunkers fiasco.</p>
<p>Like most (all?) liberal feel-good ideas, this one has exactly the opposite result than intended.</p>

<p>What the heck are you folks talking about? When it comes to Economic Development there is the long term and the short term. Of course production hasn't increased as of today. This is a long term development impact plan. </p>
<p>The problem you folks have, is a short term mentality and not being able to see beyond your nose. Which is what created these economic crises in the first place. It's called "Boom and Bust" and now we've got to try and stabilize it for the long term. Not only for ourselves, but for future generations. This ain't going to be easy and won't be completed by tomorrow afternoon. Thank Wall Street and K-Street for this. Not too mention all of the half baked Free Trade/Free Market/Anarcho-Capitalist Ideologues who lead this Nation down this "Primrose Path".     </p>

<p>Forgotten?  Yeah right.  They knew it but could not in good conscience execute a non-Keynsian stimulus plan because the current administration believes government solves problems.</p>

<p>Really ...? I suppose the Supreme Court has been a supreme failure, the Federal Courts a failure, the Congress has been a failure, the Executive a failure, the Army-Navy-Air Force- Marines all failures, the State Department a failure, the Treasury a failure, the Federal Reserve a failure, the CIA a failure, the Bureau of the Mint a failure, and all of the other Bureaus and Agencies all failures. </p>
<p>We might as well shut everything down and let the Anarchists take over. Hobbes you were right, there are those who wish to return to that primordial state where life is once again, nasty brutish and short.    </p>

<p>It is hopeful but far from certain that the recession is over or turning the corner. It is certainly not too late to have a good reason to stimulate demand for durable goods. The psychological benefit of new-car purchases is significant for consumer confidence, because Americans love cars. This program's simplicity made it very easy to sell to consumers, as shown by its enormous popularity. These sales at this time will have a greater stimulative effect than they would have had next year, if demand has risen by then, as it should. A month or two ago it seemed like very little could stimulate auto purchases. Three billion is not very much money relative to the ARRA program. Transfer payments are also effective stimulus if they take money out of savings and into business (unlike Keynsian deficit spending).</p>
<p>On the environmental side, it would have been better to have a lower ceiling on the MPG of the trade-in, as shown by how willing people were to trade in their 19 MPG cars. But that was hard to predict.</p>
<p>A good program, a few glitches notwithstanding. You guys need to loosen up and take the larger view.</p>

<p>The cash for clunkers program is a disaster because:</p>
<p>First, it caused the car makers to eat their seed corn. The cars sold this year won't be sold next year. What then?</p>
<p>Second, it is a subsidy for the Japanese. Most "clunkers" were American made, while most cars bought under the program were foreign. You can take it from there.</p>
<p>Third, the program destroyed a fleet of older cars that would have been driven in the years to come by the poor and the young who can't afford new cars.</p>
<p>Fourth, a new car puchase is an emotional as well as an economic process, so it is likely that many buyers under the "clunker" program bought without thinking things through, and will find themselves strapped for the money necessary to keep up the payments. A fortiori so as the unemployment figures rise as they continue to do. Look for an increase in repossessions in the near future.</p>

<p>Anonymous at August 26, 2009 11:44 PM, you claim that an order of magnitude more oil/energy is used to make a new car than used to drive one. That seems suspicious to me. Yes, it takes a significant amount of energy to manufacture a car, but it take a lot more to transport that vehicle 200,000 miles during its lifetime.</p>
<p>Several studies have found that less than 15% of a car's lifetime energy use comes from manufacturing and disposal combined, with nearly 90% of all energy used in the motor industry went to vehicle operation.</p>
<p>source: http://www.pacinst.org/topics/integrity_of_science/case_studies/hummer_vs_prius.pdf</p>
<p>No doubt, it will take some time (years?) to reach the point where the new car is using less net energy than the clunker, but that day *will* come!</p>
<p>Energy scientists are not dumb: they do these types of calculations every day.</p>

Such that the U.S. has International obligations to reduce its carbon emissions, this is accomplished by removing old worn out transportation vehicles from the roads which are one of the largest producers of the Nation's Carbon footprint.</p>

<p>For those who do not accept the notion that federal payments help the economy, please explain this series of events:</p>
<p>There have been 9 recessions in the past 60 years.  Every one of them was preceded by years of reduced deficit growth. Every one of them was cured with increased deficit growth.  </p>
<p>Since this surely cannot be a coincidence, the lesson is clear.  Federal spending adds money to the economy, and a growing economy requires a growing supply of money.</p>
<p>To a small degree, cash-for-clunkers adds money to the economy.  And lest you believe we now are out of economic trouble, continued recovery will require continued government spending.</p>

<p>I've read this critique of the program elsewhere, and I don't understand the basis for the assumption that drivers would drive their new non-clunkers more than their clunkers? Where is the evidence for this assumption? If it were removed from the analysis, wouldn't that show the program to be much more successful? Unless and until I see this proof, I'm not going to condemn this program. </p>

<p>A certain base of purchases would have been made over this time period.  The cost to stimulate the marginal buyer to advance their purchase was about $20,000 per vehicle.  The environmental benefits are so insignificant as to be unmeasurable in our atmosphere.  complete govt insanity.</p>

<p>"Readers continue to wait patiently for any engineers or mathematicians to post comments on this subject."</p>
<p>Aerospace engineer here; wanted to be sure you were let out of your misery.  For the record, I agree with the blog post that the cash for clunkers program was a really bad idea.  GM and Chrysler should not have been bailed out with Fed money, people's car purchases should not have been subsidized with Fed money, and people's lives shouldn't be subsidized with Fed money either.  Stand on your own two feet people.</p>
