<h3>Is This a Good Time to Raise Taxes on Gasoline? Becker</h3>
<p><br/>
When we blogged about gasoline taxes on July 21, 2008, the sharp rise in gasoline prices to over $4 a gallon reduced the gasoline consumption that contributes to global warming, local pollution, auto accidents, congestion, and other externalities from driving. I suggested that if it were desirable to use gas taxes to reduce gasoline consumption, a better time would be when gasoline prices were much lower.</p>
<p>In the little over five months since that discussion, average gasoline prices in the United States have declined by more than 60 percent to about $1.50 a gallon. In light of the July discussion, is this a good time for the federal government, perhaps particularly for local and state governments, to raise gasoline taxes? I believe that despite the free fall in gas prices, other events since that earlier posting have greatly weakened the case for higher gas taxes at this time.</p>
<p>I have opposed the bailout of GM, Ford, and Chrysler through federal loans and outright grants, and believe these companies should have been allowed to go into bankruptcy proceedings (see, e.g., my post on Dec. 16th, 2008). However, given that President Bush started a bailout, and that the new Congress is likely to extend the bailout, this would be a bad time to raise gas taxes. For higher gas prices will increase the financial difficulties of the American automakers by reducing driving and shifting demand away from the SUVs, minivans, and trucks that these companies have depended on for much of their revenues.<br/>
<br/>
A further weakening of the financial position of American carmakers would increase the size of the bailout of the American auto industry needed to prevent it from going bankrupt. This implies that higher gas taxes would have a multiplier effect on the tax burden facing American families and businesses- not only would they have to pay more for gas, but they also would at some point have to pay higher taxes to finance a larger bailout.</p>
<p>A related reason to avoid raising gas taxes now that was not so apparent when we blogged in July is that the world is in a serious recession that will get worse before it gets better. Many lower and middle-income families have lost their jobs, and many more will suffer reduced incomes during the coming months. Since increasing numbers of individuals are facing more difficult economic circumstances, this hardly is the time to raise taxes on cars used to commute to work and to shop, especially since higher gas taxes would lead to greater government spending on bailing out American carmakers. Fiscal policy during a recession should, if anything, cut rather than raise taxes, be they taxes on gasoline, personal incomes, or business. </p>
<p>President-elect Obama has reached a similar conclusion. The New York Times of Jan. 3 reported that when he was asked last month whether he would consider a much larger federal tax on gasoline, given the sharp fall in gas prices, Mr. Obama replied that American families were hurting because of rising unemployment and falling home values. They quote him as saying "So putting additional burdens on American families right now, I think, is a mistake".</p>
<p>Some proponents of the bailout to automakers want to make payments to GM, Ford, and Chrysler conditional on their making cars that are more friendly to the environment through getting greater miles per gallon of gasoline used. One frequently suggested way to do that would be to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFÃ) requirements at a more rapid rate than under present law. CAFÃ standards are presently at 27.5 mpg for cars, and 22.2 mpg for pickups, SUVs, and minivans, and they are scheduled to rise to much higher levels starting in 2011. Since foreign carmakers are better at making fuel-efficient cars than are American companies, any sharp increase in CAFÃ requirements would further weaken the competitive position of the American companies. Hence, this too would defeat the alleged purpose of the auto bailout, which is to help American companies reduce their financial problems, so that they can compete more effectively against foreign automakers.</p>
<p>Although neither higher gas taxes nor tougher fuel-efficiency standards are desirable at this time, higher taxes would be preferable to tougher standards. Both hurt GM and the other American car manufacturers, but bigger taxes are a more efficient way to economize on the use of gasoline. Higher gas prices encourage consumers to drive fewer miles with the cars they already own, especially SUVs and other gas-guzzlers. Higher gas prices also give consumers an incentive to shift purchases of new cars to more fuel-efficient cars. Bigger gas taxes stimulate greater investments in R&amp;D to produce better hybrids, battery-driven cars, and other types of cars that rely less on gasoline. In essence, raising the tax on gasoline encourage consumers and businesses to economize on all their margins of adjustment.</p>
<p>Tougher fuel standards encourage economies in the use of gasoline only by mandating the production of cars that get more miles per gallon of gasoline used. However, unlike what happens with higher gas prices, owners of more fuel-efficient cars will increase rather than decrease how much they drive precisely because these cars are more fuel-efficient. That partly offsets the reduction in gas consumption from driving more efficient cars.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that the purpose of a regulatory excise tax like the gasoline tax is two-fold: to decrease demand for the product being taxed and thus decrease its associated negative externalities, and to raise revenue that can be used to combat those externalities. In a perfect world, the amount of revenue raised will be just enough to offset the externalities caused by consumption of the product, and this makes good sense to me. Nowhere do I see room in this analysis for factors such as the general state of the economy or industry; it seems that if a gasoline excise tax is a good idea, then it is a good idea in any economic circumstance.</p>
<p>That being said, the gasoline tax is a regressive tax that hurts low and middle income wage earners -- just the folks who the state should be seeking to insulate from the recession -- more than high income individuals who are better able to handle an economic downturn. If delaying the implementation of an otherwise desirable gasoline excise tax is a good idea, then perhaps the temporary suspension of other beneficial regressive taxes such as those on  cigarettes and alcohol -- as well as state sanctioning of lotteries and gambling -- is something worth thinking about.</p>

<p>I would suggest that there be a Gas tax that was possibly implemented over 5 years at say $0.50/ gal. per year and that the money collected either be totally rebated on a per person basis or perhaps be invested as a ROTH 401k payment into an indexed fund.</p>

<p>I think everyone agrees that now is not the good time to put a tax on gas consumption.  Personally, I'm against it unless the gas tax comes along with a proportional cut in less-efficient (We don't have to debate what that is.  I don't want to start a Supply Side vs. Egalitarianism debate) or less-desirable tax such as income tax (claims it distort incentives) or even the payroll tax (ease unemployment).  If the tax is hiked gradually over the long  run people should be able to adjust.</p>
<p>I think putting strings on the bailout to produce more efficient car will have little effect on both GM's health and gasoline consumption along with its externalities.  GM is not bankrupt because they only produced gas guzzlers.  All manufacturers, even foreign, are cyclically sensitive.  None of them are doing well.  However, GM has structural problems with their fixed costs they're hopefully in the process of resolving.  GM was not stupid enough to think SUVs were going to be their bread and butter forever.  Their fixed costs were too high to ride through current credit crisis.  This was not because they failed to make a Prius competitor in 2008.  Most hikes in cafe standards burden the consumer with the manufacturers' costs of R&amp;D and production to get compliant.  If you look at auto sales, no one is demanding the high fuel standards that congress and public shamed them for not achieving.  The bulk of sedan sales are usually with the standard powertrain.  Depending on the price of gasoline and the lease, the hybrid is not always the best value (ignoring any environmental utilities).  Gas tax is the only way to encourage production and demand for efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>I'm disappointed I never once saw the word Pigouvian in this single post.</p>

<p>The use of higher CAFE standards are indirect levers which only distort the market and provide advantages to foreign competitors.</p>
<p>CAFE standards are politically easier to enact than raising of gasoline taxes.  It is the easiness which should have us moving uncomfortably in our seats.</p>
<p>If you/(we) are serious about reducing fuel consumption than we should be honest enough to have a full and open debate on the issue and make decisions in the full light of day.<br/>
If higher fuel taxes are necessary: let's discuss the matter and make a decision one way or the other.<br/>

<p>I, reluctantly, agree that now is not the time to increase gas taxes for the reasons mentioned.  </p>
<p>I'd add to the reasons the fact of our just having built this fleet of miserable gas hogs at great cost (Ha! WAS this a conspiracy? Econ terrorism??) and most people would not be able to adapt to higher gas taxes by trading their vehicles in the near future anyway.  For many the "car of the future" does not exist. My guess is that we'll see a broad mix of cars from the much ballyhooed plug-ins to CNG and more; so it seems short-sighted to throw away our existing rigs only to invest in halfway "solutions".  </p>
<p>But...... I have been a fan of moving a portion of the income tax burden to fossil fuels for 30 years or so.  Doing so would have the obvious effect of lowering consumption and increasing the efficiency of our cars, trucks buildings and even farming methods.  It seems less obvious to most that income taxes make it difficult to hire each other.  This effect is most apparent for individual home owners as business has the advantage of being able to deduct the costs of employing professional help while homeowners do not.  The result is that of creating a high incentive toward "doing it yourself" as compared to specialization.</p>
<p>So, I too lean toward a ramping up of fuel taxes over time which should now include carbon tax elements which businesses too would pay w/o deduction.  Still, many people are not sensitive to small gas taxes so something akin to the CAFE standards and gas guzzler excise taxes should be refined and retained.</p>
<p>Could it be that America MIGHT be able to think longer term and act now so that we might PLAN our future decisions?   </p>

<p>Sethstorm??  If you've "plenty of ways" to make large cars "fuel efficient" I suspect you could command quite a salary in Detroit as they're a bit stymied on traditional gassers; perhaps a new Chevy Volt will fill your needs.    </p>
<p>Today, it looks as though "the Sierra Club" has lots of company in their concern over air pollution and green house gases, but at $100 plus prices the immediate concern is that of going broke while "investing" heavily in developing the economies of OPEC while our own continues to unravel.    </p>

<p>Short term thinking has got us where we are. Now is the time to think about the long term (or at least the midterm of the next few decades). Do you think there will be more or less easily accessible oil in 2020 than today? While it's not a guarantee, my bet is on more expensive oil and less of it. Let's build a transportation system for that environment.<br/>
The argument that this is going to require new and unproven technologies is a smokescreen. Internal combustion engines have become much more efficient in the last 20 years and yet the mpg has remained much the same. The advances have gone into increased horsepower and weight. <br/>
Phase in a gas tax and better CAFE standards. Let's not put off the change for another 10 years when it's even more painful.</p>

<p>I hope that the federal government will stop throwing good money after bad, pretty soon, and cut off aid to the auto industry.  That would eliminate that argument from Dr. Beckerâs case against raising gasoline taxes.</p>
<p>The argument against raising taxes during a recession seems to make sense.  That is cited as one of the factors that turned a recession into the Great Depression 80 years ago.  However, we could perhaps offset a gas tax increase against decreases in other taxes.</p>
<p>I like Judge Posnerâs suggestion of approaching energy taxation on a broader basis than just a gasoline excise tax increase.  The issues of environmental effects, and dependence on imports from difficult foreign countries, also apply to energy uses other than automobile use.  A broader tax, such as a carbon tax, would address all of those areas.</p>
<p>Issues specific to driving, such as traffic congestion in urban areas, could be dealt with by increased use of tolls.</p>

<p>I commented on Posner's blog first so I'm only now seeing Jeff S's remark on "Pigouvian" possibilities (I agree, except I'd spell it "Pigovian";-), quite similar with what I wrote to Posner.  So I'll add one more bit: Thomas Friedman's article at http://select.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/opinion/10friedman.html?_r=1 quoting Montana governor Brian Schweitzer's idea to "Set a floor price for crude oil in the U.S. at $40 a barrel forever. That will tell Wall Street that if it invests in new, clean coal technologies â which can be run profitably at the equivalent of $40 a barrel â OPEC will never undercut them". <br/>
<p><br/>
Apart from the debate on whether clean coal in particular is a workable technology (Montana obviously has a bias towards "yes";-), the price floor aspect is the key bit -- crucial to any future private sector investment in alternative energy and conservation, and <b>so</b> much better than having the gov't pick winners and losers among clean coal, nuclear, solar, wind, etc, by direct subsidies. We must sap the Saudis' ability to periodically destroy such investments by having oil prices crash (the rest of OPEC is too greedy for that, but the Saudis play a long game and have the leverage to make it happen -- that the side effects of such undeclared price wars deeply wound Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional competing power, is a sweetener). Again, directing the income from such a floor-price tax to alternative energy subsidies is NOT ideal (I'd rather see payroll taxes cut deeply), but in any case as long as the whole package is revenue neutral the current recession should be no bar to it, no?<br/>

<p>I'm surprised neither the blogger nor the various commentators have mentioned the national security aspects of American oil consumption and the transfer of wealth to the anti- democratic regimes which supply our oil. The direct beneficiaries of the transfer (by far the largest in human history)  include countries which fund terrorism directly (e.g., Iran, Saudi Arabia) indirectly (Russia) both directly and indirectly (Venezuela) and historically, though not, perhaps, at the moment (Libya). <br/>
Our dependence on these suppliers has hamstrung our ability to have a coherent foreign policy-- witness, for example, our categorization of Saudi Arabia as a "moderate" Arab state and our inability to respond to Russia's transfer of nuclear technology to Iran.<br/>
A gasoline tax could, and, by political necessity, would, be very much a voluntary tax, through application system of partial credits and simultaneous reductions in payroll taxes. The revenues, such as they are, could be applied, again through a system of credits, to conversion of our national rolling stock to carbon neutral fuels such as algae based biodiesel etc. or carbon producing, but less dirty domestic fuels i.e., LNG. <br/>
Our economic and, hence, our national security demand an end to dependence on foreign oil and the debate must be framed in that context.</p>

<p>The regressive problem of a gas tax hike has been addressed by none other than Charles Krauthammer (I was a little surprised by the source myself). He proposed something called a Net-Zero Gas Tax. Essentially the revenue raised by such a tax would be offset by a corresponding reduction in the amount raised in payroll taxes. Thus it raises one regressive tax and reduces another. </p>

<p>I can see the point to raising taxes on gasoline as a user fee so that the funds gathered from these taxes would be dedicated to road and bridge maintenance and repair.  Such a tax increase could also have salutary side-effects such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing congestion as both Professor Becker and Judge Posner argue.  I can also see Professor Becker's point that we should delay implementing an increase in the gasoline tax due to the present economic downturn.</p>
<p>What I would also argue for, in due time, is a price floor on gasoline to provide incentives for entrepreneurs to develop alternative fuels.  Normally, I would oppose such measures as I am proposing, but the externalities that have emerged from oil are too great to simply let alone.  The most notable externality is the political volatility of the Middle East.  Since we import significant amounts of oil from Saudi Arabia as well as other Middle Eastern sources supplying other industrial nations with oil, freeing up other sources for us, we must look for ways to disengage from the Middle East.  Much of the underlying reason for terrorism is rooted in our involvement in the Middle East to keep oil flowing.  </p>
<p>In calculating the full price of oil, we must include much of our military budget.  Given those costs, a price floor to encourage the development of substitutes for gasoline would be cost effective over time.</p>

<p>Why is it that almost everyone thinks that the Internal Combustion engine's fuel efficiency is unlimited. The reality is, that the design engineers have just about maxed that efficiency out. If you're going for greater efficiency, one is going too have to invent the perpetual motion machine, develop other types of Prime Movers or radically alter the Transportation Culture and the lifestyles on which it depends.<br/>
No easy task. </p>
<p>Now, turning to "Taxation", the low prices we're seeing today are an anomaly. When the Crude prices jump, which they will, the gas prices with additional taxation will be above five dollars a gallon. Now how is this going to help revive a Consumer Based Economy? Other than drive it deeper into Depression.    </p>

<p>Neil... yeah!  I guess some of the old myths of holding back IC efficiency are still out there.  At the same time "Detroit" is criticized for a low MPG product mix, truth is they still hang onto a 50% market share.  "The Market" speaks?</p>
<p>Old "muscle cars" turned more of the gas into power, but through very high compression ratios requiring leaded high octane.  Then we've had to cam them such that all the fuel is burned inside the engine by comparison.  </p>
<p>Apparently  "well to wheel" conversion of oil BTU's is dropping due to the well being further out and deeper, and more fuel being wasted, idling in some 100 grid-locked choke points around the US.  The WTW number is about 15%  (RMI.org)  Widespread use of plug in hybrids should improve the WTW ratio and offer us a wider choice of fuels. </p>
<p>Someone recently came close to setting a Class drag racing record on E-85.  I've long suspected that eth will require a special engine instead of just fueling a gasoline engine with eth.  But is is worth it???</p>
<p>That "price floor" taxation has some merits, though pols will likely lack the spine to set it high enough.  In "better times" it's tempting to make gas taxes ramp up from that floor as a percentage of the sale price.  That way those tempted to meddle with gas prices would know that their best and most wasteful customer would quickly go on a diet and drive demand down while filling our OWN coffers.  </p>

<p>I'm disappointed that Prof. Becker frames the discussion of gas taxes simply as "higher vs. lower overall taxes", and not surprisingly, favors lower taxes.</p>
<p>The far more interesting question is "For a given amount of tax revenue, how should it be collected?".  For most economists, probably including Prof. Becker, the answer is that Pigovian taxes like a gas tax are far preferable to taxes on work and savings.</p>
<p>Prof. Becker should add his voice to the majority of economists who favor higher gas and energy taxes, with the proceeds used to cut other taxes.  Tax negative externalities (pollution, congestion, accidents, climate change, terrorist funding, etc) not things with positive externalities.</p>
<p>If he's concerned about the recession or the size of gov't in general, feel free to cut other taxes by MORE than we raise gas taxes.</p>
<p>The questions of total tax amount and type of tax used are completely orthogonal.  It's a bit pity Prof. Becker has confused the issue.  Let's hope he clarifies it in a future blog post.</p>

Though you'll have to fight your way through a lot of half-backed "Libertarians" and such who seem to think the income tax is THE standard and if "the government"  (US?) were to shift the tax to fuels etc that would be government intervention and steering.

<p>A direct implication of your discussion is that the U.S. government should not be buying oil to fill its strategic reserves, low energy price is one of the few positive things for the economy right now.  It is frustrating to see the government pushing up the oil price on one hand and contemplating massive stimulus package on the other.</p>

<p>Dr. Becker, </p>
<p>I was just wondering if there were any papers written (and/or models created) that deal with continuously-adjustable taxes. In the case of gas taxes, as I see it, this could work by adjusting a daily and/or hourly gas tax based on a spot oil and gas price volatility and some sort of convolved average of the 1,2,6-month forward contracts. I'm just thinking of this in the sense of a theoretical framework for testing what the effects of various types of dynamic gas taxes, which may be useful in such a scenario. Considering the technological advances in the gas distribution infrastructure, this may be possible in a limited number of locations and I think it would be pretty interesting to see the consumer response to such a taxing mechanism. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Tarun:  I've thought a bit about the effect of fuel taxes that have been suggested to vary such that the end price stays the same or nearly the same.  ie. The we find out, some price, $3? is something of a sweet spot in terms of affordability and lowering consumption.  The tax would then be the variable margin between costs, profit et al and selling price.  </p>
<p>I conclude it would be inflationary, as the consumer would have no reason to price shop, and the wholesalers and retailer would have reason to wink and say "Well, the margin is just going to Unc anyway..." and take the margin for themselves. Government then comes back for more taxes?  </p>
<p>It's a very curious biz anyway, with retail margins very thin....... a nickel maybe .15 for a volume guy who buys well, with apparently the profit being made up in the convenience store where a soft drink or coffee earns more than half a tank of gas.</p>

<p>Sliding scale taxation, that changes from hour to hour, minute to minute; Great! Not only will we have, increased "PRICE VOLATILITY", due to hedging and outright speculation in the Commodities Market for Crude and Fuel (see the Cauliflower Case), but the tax scales are manipulated as well. Not only on the Federal level, but also on the State, County and Municipal level.</p>
<p>Just one question, how is the Transportation Industry supposed to write Contracts for the moving of goods when they don't know what their fuel costs are going to be when it comes time to transport? And what about the producers whose product needs to be transported. How do they figure out their costs?   </p>

<p>Jack: I suppose. I just asked the question from a more theoretical perspective (I'm a mathematics student, so have a variable tax would give one some interesting academic and not necessarily practical problems to analysis with respect to the gas tax), and there may never be an equilibrium, especially considering that over 1/2 of the world's population has access to government subsidized gas (which may make some of the supply assumptions different)</p>
<p>Neilehat: Again, it's more of an academic question as opposed to a practical question for me.
