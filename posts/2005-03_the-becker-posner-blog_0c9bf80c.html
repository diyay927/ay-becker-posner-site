			Posner has very good comments, which I mainly agree with. I will try to discuss a little the foundation of bankruptcy, a topic that Posner discusses only briefly. 

In previous blog entries, we discussed student loans and the difficulty of using human capital, such as education or earning power, as collateral to get loans. People with significant assets can offer these assets as collateral, although as Posner indicates, various bankruptcy laws exempt the housing and certain other assets of debtors from being possessed by creditors. But still it is much harder to borrow on the basis of human capital alone because there is no collateral. This is why the poor are most vulnerable in the credit market since if they get into difficulties, they have few assets to sell to cover their consumption and also payments on credit card and other loans.

Lacking collateral, the poor would pay higher interest rates even without bankruptcy protection because managing their loans is more costly, and collection via garnishment and the like is expensive. The possibility of discharging debts through bankruptcy may add significantly to the rates they pay. Posner shows that a vicious cycle is created because higher interest payments are more of a burden if unemployment or other difficulties strike.

One approach to breaking this circle is to make human capital loans not dischargeable through bankruptcy-except in extreme cases. I suggested in an earlier entry that loans to finance the purchase of the right to immigrate should also not be dischargeable. Creditors would have the right to garnish wages for a certain period of time, as under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. The new reform of bankruptcy laws moves in this direction, the same direction already used for student and other loans when governments, not the private sector, are the creditors.

Another approach that helps provide insurance is to encourage �equity� loans when human capital is the main collateral available. By equity loans I mean a system where creditors share in both the higher and lower earnings of debtors. So when earnings of a debtor are higher, the amount he or she pays back is greater than when their earnings are lower. This system is quite common in financing agricultural loans in poorer countries, as demonstrated  by the research on loans in developing nations by Robert Townsend and others.

Since these type of loans already exist in poor nations with limited bookkeeping techniques and primitive commercial credit markets, there is no reason why they could not become more common in the richer nations, whether the US, Europe, or Japan. Debtors might have to submit tax forms that verify their incomes, the same way that these are required in obtaining student aid, Medicaid, and some other assistance. 

The law might have to be written to encourage such equity loans. They may not always be feasible, but they are a more attractive method of �social� insurance than the bankruptcy system. They avoid a lot of litigation over assets, garnishment, and the like. In addition, those debtors doing better than expected automatically back pay more, while those doing badly automatically pay back less, possibly nothing until they do better. This to me seems to be a much better way than tinkering with bankruptcy laws in meeting the legitimate needs of both creditors and debtors in an uncertain economic world.
