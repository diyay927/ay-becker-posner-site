<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"></span></o:p></p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">I agree with Becker that the <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:place></st1:city> conference on global warming was an embarrassing and total flop. As he explains, there is no prospect in the foreseeable future for an international treaty that will limit emissions of carbon dioxide. A different approach is required.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">And desperately required; for I believe that the threat of global warming is very serious, and that it is not merely a long-term threat. (If it were, there would be no urgency about taking measures to slow it, for normal technological progress will eventually solve the problem at low cost.) The particular danger which concerns me, and which I emphasized in my book <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Catastrophe: Risk and Response</em> (2004), is that of <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">abrupt</em> global warming. The climate equilibrium (like the economic equilibrium, as we have discovered) is unstable, in part because of feedback effects. For example, as the Alaskan and Siberian permafrost melts, methane, a potent greenhouse gas, is released into the atmosphere, causing surface temperatures to rise, which in turn accelerates the release of methane. And also as surface temperatures rise, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere increases—and water vapor is a potent greenhouse gas, and so increasing it accelerates the warming trend. The ocean’s capacity to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide is limited, so that as emissions increase, more remain in the atmosphere longer. Similarly, the destruction of forests to make way for agriculture increases net carbon emissions because trees absorb more carbon dioxide (during the day, in photosynthesis) than they emit (at night, when they are breathing oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">The effects of rapidly rising concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in heating the earth’s surface could produce such catastrophes as the melting of the Greenland and Antarctic ice caps, which would raise the level of the oceans by several feet, and the melting of the Arctic ice cap, which by diluting the salt in the North Atlantic could shift the Gulf Stream from northeast to north, which would give Europe, because of its northern latitude, a Siberian climate. These are catastrophes that could occur within the next one or two decades.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">No probabilities can be attached to abupt global warming, so no expected cost can be calculated that would enable a cost-benefit analysis of preventive measures. But when the likelihood of an immense disaster cannot be estimated, yet does not seem negligible, there is an argument for taking preventive measures, at least if they are not prohibitively costly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">The free-rider problem is defeating efforts to limit carbon emissions. Emissions limitations even by a major emitter (the two biggest emitters are <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region> and the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>) would have only a slight effect on the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It would not reduce the concentration; it would not keep it from increasing; it would just slow the rate of increase slightly. The major effect would a transfer of wealth to any country that did not limit its emissions; that country would have a competitive advantage because it would not bear the cost of reducing emissions. As other countries reduced production because of higher costs, the free-riding countries would increase their production (because they would have a comparative advantage)--and with it their carbon emissions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">The free-rider problem would not be serious if the cost of reducing emissions by significant amounts were low; but it is high. Given existing technology, it requires a substantial reduction (whether brought about by emissions taxes or by quotas) in the use of motor vehicles, in the generation of electricity (other than in nuclear reactors), and in the clearing of forests for agrcultural and other uses. What is needed to make a solution to global warming feasible is <em>cheap</em> technological fixes. One is actually at hand, though strongly resisted by environmentalists (I am tempted to put “short-sighted” in front of “environmentalists”), and that is to inject sulphur dioxide, a potent sun-screen gas, into the atmosphere. This solution (called “geoengineering”) is resisted because sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere causes acid rain; but acid rain is a far less serious problem than global warming.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">Other possible technological solutions include injecting carbon emissions from electrical power generation underground, cheap battery-driven motor vehicles, and artificial “bacteria” that would devour carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. All of these solutions would require large investments in research and development to achieve feasibility at low cost. The benefits, however, would include not only reduced carbon emissions but also reduced dependence by the <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Japan</st1:country-region>, and many other countries on foreign producers of oil and natural gas, which include unstable countries and countries hostile to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and its allies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;"> </span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="font-family: Century Schoolbook;">The <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region> and other nations are financing the development of carbon-limiting technologies, but at low levels relative to the need. I favor carbon taxes to increase the incentives for private R &amp; D by producers who would be affected by such taxes and by firms interested in supplying emission-reducing technology to such producers. Private innovation is anyway likely to be more efficient than government-sponsored R &amp; D. Emission taxes would have painful allocative effects in the short run, and their imposition should be deferred until the economy improves significantly. But when imposed they would generate tax revenue as well as affecting R &amp; D incentives, and we shall need additional tax revenue to control our immense and growing public debt.</span></p>
