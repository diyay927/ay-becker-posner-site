			A front page article today in the New York Times points out
that around 1990 the Republican Party shifted away from an emphasis on
balancing the federal budget to an emphasis on the level of taxes. I believe
that this shift was in the right direction, and it is highly relevant in
understanding the Republicans’ position on what to do to prevent the so-called
“fiscal cliff” in 2013.
<p>Supporters of a balanced budget approach to fiscal policy want
federal spending and revenue to be about equal to each other in the long run.
This means that any long-term growth in the deficit and in the public debt should
be less than the growth in GDP. By contrast, the level of taxation approach emphasizes
that the levels of federal spending and taxation are the primary determinants
of the effects of the federal government on the economy, including incentives
to work hard, invest, and start businesses. </p>
<p>The level of taxation ultimately determines the size of
government since no government can continue to spend substantially more than its
revenues. Greater government spending may help stimulate an economy coming out
of a major recession, although the absence of any clear stimulus to the economy
from the Obama stimulus package raises serious questions about the ease of
stimulating an economy with fiscal policy. However, the level of federal
government spending also has major direct effects on an economy, such as
through spending on medical care, defense, and subsidizing the production of
ethanol. Greater government spending also tends to crowd out spending by the
private sector on consumption and investments.</p>
<p>Concern about the size of federal spending is particularly
relevant at this juncture since federal spending has grown substantially during
the past 10 years, especially rapidly during the past four years. In 2007,
federal spending was under 20% of GDP, while it rose to over 24% of GDP in
2012. Less than half of this increased spending has been due to the growth in government
spending on medical care, social security, and defense, while the rest is the
result of increased spending on many other programs. Since greater government spending
is also the cause of most of the growth in budget deficits, even those who
target budget deficits, let alone those who target total taxation and spending,
might well expect most of the reduction in deficits would come from spending cuts
(spread out over time) rather than from higher tax rates. </p>
<p>Concentration on the level and nature of taxation implies
support for widening the tax base through cutbacks in various unjustified exemptions
and deductions from taxable incomes. Many special treatments of particular
incomes should just be eliminated. The two most important deductions from
taxable income are interest on mortgages and charitable contributions. Deductions
of interest on mortgages are hard to justify from an efficiency standpoint,
while the case for deductions for charitable contributions is stronger. Still,probably
a cap on total deductions would be the best way politically to limit
deductions. Such a cap would mainly hit higher income persons, and would raise
the effective marginal tax rate for some taxpayers, but it would generally improve
efficiency in the economy’s use of resources.</p>
<p>Many commentators have questioned how Republican members of
the House could fail to support Representative John Boehner’s “Plan B” that
would raise tax rates only on incomes over $1 million. I agree that the suggested
tax increase on such a small fraction of taxpayers is unlikely to have much of
a negative effect on the economy. But by the same token, President Obama’s
compromise suggestion to raise tax rates only on incomes above $400,000 will also
raise little additional tax revenue. This explains why the president also wants
to raise taxes on dividends, capital gains, and estates, and reduce deductions.</p>
<p>The president is clearly in the political driver’s seat after
winning reelection in a major victory. In the end he will probably get
something much closer to what he wants than what Republicans in Congress want
to offer. However, this does not mean that a position that wants major cutbacks
in government spending and opposes increases in taxation that are not due to
tax reforms, is a sign of intransigence rather than a thought-through
opposition to larger government and bigger taxes.</p>
