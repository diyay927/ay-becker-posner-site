<h3>The Future of Newspapers--Posner</h3>
<p>Warren Buffett, who is a wit as well as a multibillionaire, said with reference to the fact that Bernard Madoff's long-running Ponzi scheme came to light during the financial collapse of last fall that until the tide goes out, you don't know who's swimming naked. A year ago Becker and I blogged about the decline of the newspaper industry. A year later the decline has accelerated. The economic crisis has hurt the newspaper industry as it has so many industries. The question is whether it will recover (or at least rejoin its slower downward path of last year) when the economy as a whole recovers; or has the economic crisis merely revealed the terminal status of the industry.</p>
<p>I am pessimistic about a recovery by the newspapers. One reason is the current economic situation. A serious, protracted economic crisis can result in changes in consumer behavior that persist after the end of the crisis. A change in consumption, even in some sense involuntary, can be a learning experience. People make what they think will be merely temporary adjustments in their consumption behavior to reduce financial distress but may discover that they like elements of their new consumption pattern; and businesses too, which have reduced their newspaper (and other print-media) ad expenditures drastically. They may never go back.</p>
<p>Newspaper ad revenues fell by almost 8 percent in 2007, a surprising drop in a non-recession year (the current economic downturn began in the late fall of that year), and by almost 23 percent the following year, and accelerated this year. In the first quarter of 2009 newspaper ad revenues fell 30 percent from their level in the first quarter of 2008. This fall in revenue, amplified by drops in print circulation (about 5 percent last year, and running at 7 percent this year--and readership is declining in all age groups, not just the young), have precipitated bankruptcies of major newspaper companies and, more important, the disappearance of a number of newspapers, including major ones, such as the <em>Rocky Mountain News</em> and the <em>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</em>. Falling revenues have led to layoffs of some 20,000 employees of the remaining newspapers. Print journalism has come to be regarded as a dying profession. Online viewership and revenues have grown but not nearly enough to offset the decline in ad revenues. Even the most prestigious newspapers, such as the <em>New York Times</em>, the <em>Wall Street Journal,</em> the <em>Washington Post</em>, and <em>USA Today</em>, have experienced staggering losses.</p>
<p>News, as well the other information found in newspapers, is available online for nothing, including at the websites of the newspapers themselves, who thus are giving away content. The fact that online viewing is rising as print circulation is falling indicates a shift of consumers from the paid to the free medium. The economic downturn has doubtless accelerated the trend, but economic recovery is unlikely to reverse it. To repeat my earlier point, many of the people who have switched under economic pressure to the free medium may find themselves as happy or happier and hence will not switch back when their financial condition improves.</p>
<p>Moreover, while in many industries a reduction in output need not entail any reduction in the quality of the product, in newspaper it does entail a reduction in quality. Most of the costs of a newspaper are fixed costs, that is, costs invariant to output--for they are journalists' salaries. A newspaper with shrinking revenues can shrink its costs only by reducing the number of reporters, columnists, and editors, and when it does that quality falls, and therefore demand, and falling demand means falling revenues and therefore increased pressure to economize--by cutting the journalist staff some more. This vicious cycle, amplified by the economic downturn, may continue until very little of the newspaper industry is left.</p>
<p>So what will happen to news and information? Online news is free for two reasons. First, in the case of a newspaper, the marginal cost of providing content online is virtually zero, since it is the same content (or a selection of the content) in a different medium. Second, online providers of news who are not affiliated with a newspaper can provide links to newspaper websites and paraphrase articles in newspapers, in neither case being required to compensate the newspaper.</p>
<p>As newspaper revenues decline, newspaper content becomes thinner and thinner--but by the same token so does the linked or paraphrased newspaper content found in web sites that have no affiliation with a newspaper. If eventually newspapers vanish, online providers will have higher advertising revenues (because newspaper advertising will have disappeared) and may decide to charge for access to their online news, and so the critical question is whether online advertising revenues will defray the costly news-gathering expenses incurred at this time by newspapers. Imagine if the <em>New York Times </em>migrated entirely to the World Wide Web. Could it support, out of advertising and subscriber revenues, as large a news-gathering apparatus as it does today? This seems unlikely, because it is much easier to create a web site and free ride on other sites than to create a print newspaper and free ride on other print newspapers, in part because of the lag in print publication; what is staler than last week's news. Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, might be necessary to keep free riding on content financed by online newspapers from so impairing the incentive to create costly news-gathering operations that news services like Reuters and the Associated Press would become the only professional, nongovernmental sources of news and opinion.<br/>

<div id="c210626">
<p>As always a thought-provoking post.  But I wonder about a few of your points:</p>
<p>1.  You say most of the costs of a newspaper are journalist salaries, but I would think these trivial compared to the production and distribution costs of the newspaper itself.</p>
<p>2.  You say that online news is free, but that is so only in the sense that most sites don't charge direct fees to the readers in the form of subscription or pay-per-view.  (The Wall Street Journal has a hybrid model, with some summaries and content free and the rest charged by subscription.)  Online news isn't truly free, for the sites take advertising to underwrite their (lesser) costs.  So reading the "free" content also means being exposed to the ads.</p>
<p>3.  Of course the same is true in part of the printed newspapers--the price to the consumer is subsidized by advertisers who, again, get exposure to readers.  Even newspapers that are public companies don't break down their costs and revenues in a useful way on the balance sheet, but one might wonder if the breakdown is something like the advertising revenue pays for the journalist salaries while the price for the paper covers the printing and distribution costs.  If that were true, then eliminating the media and moving all the advertising over to the online model would mean no loss of profits.</p>
<p>4.  Again no one knows how the breakdown of advertising and payment by consumers nets out for the printed paper, but the breakdown I suggest is supported by the success of broadcast television, which charges nothing to consumers much as much online news charges nothing.  Yet broadcast television is still profitable, so apparently the advertising more than covers the costs of production and distribution.</p>
<p>5.  The biggest disaster for the printed papers has been the loss of classified ads, which were apparently the cash cow, now migrating to online venues such as Craiglist, where they can be easily searched (and where the advertisers do the labor of typing and categorizing).  Newspapers tried to create their own classified portal in 1999, but were stymied by their own fear of cannibalizing the print market and possible antitrust intervention.  The joint venture failed miserably, while Craigslist, on a development budget of almost nothing, proceeded to eat the lunch of the printed ads.  The decline of the printed papers has been greatly hastened by the loss of classified.</p>
<p>6.  It may be, as you say, that today's online venues simply link to journalism paid for by the remaining newspapers and therefore, in the long run, are running an unsustainable business.  But a new model of journalism is emerging with the collaborative tools of the Internet, where individuals post photos, videos, and facts they have access to and the online community stitches this together.  Obviously this method is in its nascent form and may not replace "professional" journalists (most of whom do little if any investigative work anyway).  But maybe it will.</p>
<p>My experience working in the newspaper industry as a consultant during the early years of the Internet suggests their management was more resistant than other industries to accept the reality that a new medium required new business approaches.  Perhaps because so many of the leading U.S. papers are privately-held, family-owned businesses (or largely so), the inability to adjust to a disruptive technology was higher.</p>

<p>A newswire duopoly would be dangerous.  I share Professor Becker's optimism about social networks, but I'm not yet convinced that the cloud can exactly replicate Woodward-style investigative journalism.</p>
<p>However, we still have the very profitable Economist.  Network news and cable news could pick up some of the slack as well.  These outlets also have an online presence and could hire recently laid-off journalists at a discounted rate to bolster their credibility, give them exclusive coverage, and provide fodder for discussion on air.  I wouldn't be surprised if we see tighter integration in currently existing media empires, like Rupert Murdoch's.</p>

<p>Tow points:</p>
<p>1. The cost of creating the content is by far the largest line item on a newspaper's P&amp;L. What's happening is that we're losing edited content.  </p>
<p>Edited. Content.</p>
<p>2. The revenue from online doesn't even come close to covering the cost of creating journalism.</p>
<p>Whoever said "GIGO" is dead-on.</p>
<p>"News" has morphed into entertainment; one need look no further than Rush Limbaugh for proof (although there are equals on the left as well). </p>
<p>It says a great deal that Gen X &amp; Y regard John Stewart and the Daily Show as their most trusted source of news. Stewart may be a comedian, but he's also perhaps the best interviewer out there today.</p>
<p>Unless publishers can come up with a model that supports the process of creating high-quality, edited content, we are at risk of losing perhaps the single most important underpinning of our democracy.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to local News content? I know more about what's going on in the likes of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the like than I do in my own backyard. It has become so much more easy and cheaper to just "tear" off a News story from the Wire Services than hire and train News Reporters. As for the new "Medium" of online content, the "Press" is just going to have to adapt or perish. Much like it has with Radio and Television.    </p>

<p>Bar access using copyright? Why, I think media companies have sufficiently distorted the copyright laws enough in this regard. I don't think copyright owners should be given any more rights--and using copyright law to raise revenue's for newspapers is probably not the best way to "save" the newspaper industry. </p>

<p>I am somewhat troubled by the reasoning in this portion of your piece, which you use to support your conclusion that changes in the copyright laws are necessary:</p>
<p>"Imagine if the New York Times migrated entirely to the World Wide Web. Could it support, out of advertising and subscriber revenues, as large a news-gathering apparatus as it does today? This seems unlikely, because it is much easier to create a web site and free ride on other sites than to create a print newspaper and free ride on other print newspapers, in part because of the lag in print publication; what is staler than last week's news."</p>
<p>Underlying your assertion is an unstated premise that consumers view all websites equally.  I am not sure that I agree.  Using your example, I think the New York Times enjoys the benefit of a strong reputation.  As such, consumers will be more inclined to patronize NYTimes.com than a competing website that aggregates and regurgitates its news from The New York Times.</p>
<p>It's a bit unclear in your blog post whether you're also assuming that NYT will have to begin charging for its content if it fully migrates to the Internet.  Again, this is a premise that I think must be more fully assessed.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the copyright solution you have proposed carries with it many problems; problems that themselves warrant an entirely separate treatment.  I'd be fascinated if you'd take that topic into consideration for a future blog post.  </p>

<p>Yikes!  This statement is so disconnected from reality, I'm not sure where to begin.</p>
<p>First, you already need the copyright holder's consent to access copyright materials.  So there is no "expansion" necessary. Unrestricted, public access to online content is already by their consent.  The license to access it is implicit in putting on the net.  If the copyright holder did not want their content online, they do not need to put it there.  If other do it, then they risk copyright infringement.</p>
<p>Second, expanding copyright protection to exclude paraphrasing is about the most ridiculous idea.  Quoting and citing sources (even block quoting) has a long history in both journalism, writing and scholarship.  Why would you treat the web differently?  How would you ever detect "infringement" of someone slavishly copying text (as a paraphrase) from a printed version and simply linking to the online story?</p>
<p>Third, I'm not sure how expanding copyright to include linking is helpful.  A "link" is effectively a plain text source citation.  Expanding copyright protection to limit linking would either introduce inefficiencies (copy &amp; paste the source citation into the url bar) or go to far and prevent people from adding footnotes.  Again, source citation has a long history in both journalism, writing and scholarship.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that Judge Posner assumes too much about the effects of online access to content.  If online access to content is killing the revenue making portion of the business, then what rational company would keep publishing online?  The truth is that online readership is still readership.  Readership means relevance.  Relevance means advertisers.  Advertisers mean money.</p>

<p>Another interesting thought concerns the effect the decline in print journalism will have on writing and literature.  Many great (or OK) writers began as journalists.  Print journalism is perhaps the most abundant source of written communcation.  As journalism focuses less on long-form articles and more on other forms of communication (videos, tweets, etc.), the effect on writing and literature could be profound.</p>

<p>If the traditional news gathering and newspaper circulation becomes an unsustainable business model (ads won't pay for it anymore), then the newspapers may become outlets for interest groups.  Instead of having journalism intended to be objective, having newspapers published by interest groups will promote their causes at the expense of others. </p>

<p>I think one other feature that (so far at least) is lacking in on-line reporting or blogging/commentary is an overall lack of investigative journalism.  It can take months or years of continuous research and publication - a recent example is the Chicago Tribune's investagation of political clout and student admissions at the University of Illinois that is still on-going and in litigation over FOIA requests, not to mention all the Rod Blagovich stories.  These are quite costly to conduct.</p>
<p>Plenty of local government and business scandals are uncovered this way (and certainly stories with national implications like Watergate).  Is there a substitute for this as the newspaper model declines?  It's not part of, at least as far as I am aware, the Reuters business model.<br/>

<p>This may be the way forward.  McCain/Feingold prevents (or is intended to prevent) money from flowing into politics and thereby political advertising.</p>
<p>If a political group simply bought or started a newspaper, it would seem that it could spend as much as it wants and publish anything it wants with First Amendment protection.</p>

<p>Newspapers have also assisted in accelerating their own demise.  A few issues that I've noticed in many "reputable" newspapers:</p>
<p>#1 The post acknowledges liberal bias, but not only is the information often slanted, articles often fail to present any alternative viewpoint.  </p>
<p>#2 Headlines, written to grab attention, are misleading relative to the actual content of the articles.  </p>
<p>#3 The one advantage that the "reputable" papers should exploit is fact-checking.  There have been a number of articles in these papers that I've seen that are blatently lacking in this department.  Granted, they are the exception rather than the rule, but if I can't trust the New York Times to provide more thoroughly researched content than a blog, why bother with them?  Even when they make an error, they do a poor job of informing the readers of the mistake (perhaps a deliberate ploy to conceal their errors, thereby signaling accuracy?).  </p>

<p>Gary Becker and Judge Richard Posner is correct that newspapers on the decline.</p>
<p>This became evident with the introduction of online word processing and the Internet being married at the altar of E-Mail. </p>
<p>Television certainly was the foreplay of what was down the road with the shortening of the attention span of those watching as a responsive parties in this media of information.</p>
<p>It also signals the future for reading and books.</p>
<p>Good writing will become a thing of the past</p>
<p>We have already the future in many magazines. Most arenât worth the paper that they are printed on. Here, articles have become shorter and less critical, lacking a knowledge base.</p>

<p>How many readers would like to have the old Scholar back with Joseph Epstein at the helm?</p>

<p>I think that it's interesting to assume that the reason readers are migrating from printed newspapers to online versions is because the online versions are free. Perhaps that's part of it, but I think that it's also the case that the online version is simply more convenient in today's world. People at work can (and do) check the website of the NY Times throughout the day - how many regular employees have you ever seen kicking back with a printed newspaper on company time? Online newspapers are also available to our increasingly mobile world via iPhones, Blackberrys, and other PDA / smartphone devices. While it is true that the printed paper is mobile, there's a difference in the convenience of scrolling through the news on your phone or PDA and between dealing with folding and unfolding a newspaper.</p>
<p>In a way, this is similar to the debate about .mp3s and the music industry. For years, the music industry decided to litigate rather than innovate. Consumers didn't flock to .mp3s primarily because they were free - they did so because they were convenient. They wanted their media when they wanted it, without having to make a trip to the local Tower Records store. One only has to look at the success of the Apple Music Store (and its competitors) for confirmation of this. When music was made available to consumers in an instantaneous and convenient form for a nominal fee, consumers were more than willing to buy it rather than obtain it illegally. The other thing that Apple did to change the way that music was sold was to offer individual songs as opposed to full length albums.</p>
<p>I think that if newspapers ever want to start obtaining revenue from consumers through their online operations, they should not look towards the subscription model (a la the now defunct Times Select) but rather the microtransaction model. This is similar to the music industry moving away from offering only full CDs (~$15.99 a pop) to offering individual songs (~$.99 per). It's a lot easier to convince someone to pay a penny or dime per article that they consume than to ask everyone to pony up $15 or $30 / mo (which is what it would have to be if the industry were to attempt to sustain itself entirely on such revenue). You could always have subscription plans for high volume users or corporate / academic environments, but I think microtransactions are an intriguing solution for the average consumer.</p>

<p>Draconian copyright laws are not the answer.</p>
<p>The newspaper's old business model may be dead. This doesn't mean that there is no business model by which news gathering can make economic sense. National Public radio, for example, receives very little of its funding from government sources, even though it has a government charter. The Colorado Independent, in the sidebar, also has a grant based business model, rather than an advertising or subscription based business model.</p>
<p>Before commercial investor owned, advertising funded companies came to dominate news collection in this country, political parties provided a funding base for most newspapers, including one of the predecessors of the Rocky Mountain News. Before newspapers that served the general public came along, we had "foreign correspondents" whose business model was similar to that of today's investment analysts. Notably, newspapers in a fair share of the world manage without any copyright protection at all for their news reporting.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the fine arts sector operates on a mixed of fee for service, advertising and contributions for donors, something close to the National Public Radio business model. So do many private educational institutions, and most private hospitals started out that way although many are now profitable from fee for service alone.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Associated Press, as its name suggests, is not itself an advertising revenue driven, investor owned operation at all. It is a producer cooperative of participating newspapers, in which participating newspapers generate much of the total content available. Most of the member newspapers are advertising revenue driven, investor owned corporations, but the AP is not. Members contribute both funds and content to the shared enterprise with funding requirements based on audience size, just as NPR member stations do.</p>
<p>Also, fair use blogging of news stories is a big part of what drives traffic to newspaper websites. The notion that this kind of citation reduces newspaper website traffic is probably empirically wrong.</p>
<p>In Japan and New Zealand, at least, probably elsewhere, part of the way TV and radio ccontent is paid for is with a tax on each TV and radio you own. </p>
<p>The item by item licensing contemplated by copyright law is horrifically cumbersome in practice and if it was really required in practice, every commercial radio station in the country would soon collapse under a mountain of copyright suits. In fact, the only way commercial radio exists at all is for the copyrights in the vast majority of the songs to be available by paying a small number of blanket licenses based upon audience size, and then to impose record keeping requirements on licensees. The data from the radio stations is then used to divy up the the royalties to artists and music studios and others entitled to them.</p>
<p>Why do I get a newspaper even though I could get most of the content online? Simple. Ease of use and scanning issues aside, I want the coupons that come with it and it is nice to have the physical paper around the house for various purposes (like surface protection from children's paint projects). </p>

<p>I agree with Posner but I don't think he goes far enough... The free-riding problem isn't specific to print, Reuters and Associated Press are headed for disaster too. Once one news agency purchases a copy of a Reuters or Associated Press article, then every other online news agency can paraphrase it for free and keep any advertising money they have on their site. The result is that the wire services will have fewer paying customers and their quality will decrease as well.</p>
<p>If law can solve this problem, which I'm pretty certain it cant, its goal should be to funnel money away from the free-riders and towards the real news-collecting companies, whether they be print or a wire service. I don't think Posner's suggested strengthening of copyright would work, but it is a nice thought.</p>

<p>One point that no one has mentioned is that one big reason that newspapers are failing is that they are competing with the U.S. Postal Service. Take a look in your mailbox. Most likely, over half of what is there every day is bulk advertising. Thirty years ago, that came in your newspaper. Then the USPS made delivery of those ads cheaper by mail. Today, newspapers are making less than what they would have without the US government's competition for delivering ads. That means that they make less profit, print a lower quality paper, or have to raise subscription or ad prices.</p>

<p>1. A newspaper without readers is fishwrap.</p>
<p>Newspapers can voluntarily take themselves off the net.</p>
<p>If newspapers want to follow their readers to the net, the price is giving up control of their content to their readers discretion.</p>
<p>Readers don't want information that they can't use, that is, republish, copy and forward. Make these things impossible and we readers are gone.</p>
<p>Paywalls haven't worked except in a few limited instances where paying (e. g, Wall St Journal) is tax deductible.</p>
<p><br/>
2. The best coverage of any newsworthy event is from people who were there when it happened.</p>
<p>Reporters can't be everywhere, nor are they. Newspapers only report old news. They get new news off the net ... like their readers.</p>
<p><br/>
3. Newspapers haven't operated in the public interest for years. Public interest reporting, when it existed, was a frill made possible by the paper's monopoly delivery system profits.</p>
<p>There's no public interest in supporting the newspaper's obsolete business model.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to local News content? I know more about what's going on in other countries and the like than I do in my own frontyard. It has become so much more easy and cheaper to just "tear" off a News story from the Wire Services than hire and train News Reporters and hard workers.

<p>A study last year by the Neiman Foundation found that at least 85% of all the content on "news" websites, blogs, radio and television originated with a print newspaper or its free website. In other words, new media is much more reactive when it comes to news than proactive. </p>
<p>When the print newspapers and their websites go away, so will much of the blogosphere and alternate sources that everyone seems to be counting on.</p>

<p>Another reason for the demise of newspapers is that the quality of journalism as been in decline for some time now, independent of economic circumstances. </p>
<p>Not only does one find news content online practically free but one can search a variety of sources and therefore perspectives and thus can gain a greater insight into whatever news story one is interested in. </p>
<p>Journalism that raises questions, that provokes, that stimulates thought is a thing of the past, at least in newspapers but online this is not so. </p>

<p>Even without going into the copyright expansion argument, I can see one really big hole in this plan: the newspaper industry has been failing for decades, even before the Internet was available for public consumption.</p>
<p>Papers like the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner (RIP 1984) did not fail because someone stole their content by linking to it or by making it available for free online. They failed because their business model (and that of the whole newspaper industry) was based upon above-average profits, which are going away.</p>
<p>Publishers themselves killed off their industry when they let local coverage die in their zeal to focus on wire stories. If 500 papers all print mostly the same wire service stories, what reason is there for more than one or two of them to exist? If you want readers, you have to cover LOCAL news that is not available from any other outlet. As long as papers fail to respond to the needs of their communities, they are doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Many news stories are merely unresearched ripoffs of Wikipedia. Reporters do not dig into things, seeking to uncover, research, and reveal. Instead, they trundle from press conference to press conference and relish in the details of the latest celebrity divorce. Away with that tripe and trivia! Away with your moralizing and attempts to persuade me to your political view! Give me the what, the who, the where, the how, and the why, and let me decide whether it is good or bad and how to react to it.</p>
<p>That said, I love the dead-tree version of the news, but it is sixteen hours old by the time I have a chance to read it. It is far better to turn on the TV or read it online soon after the event, even without the delightful tactile sensations that accompany the print version of the news.</p>

<p>I did after all find this blog post by a link from another site. Did they break the law?</p>
<p>What a ridiculous idea you have of the web.</p>
<p>Why provide a trackback url? That is just asking people to distribute your content on the web.</p>
<p>If newspapers are not willing to innovate then they will die. This is the same as everything throughout the years. Things move on with technology. It always has and it always will.</p>
<p>Or would you prefer technology to never evolve? Shall we all sit round our log fires in our caves, or is that too far?</p>
<p>Of course their ad revenue decreased. People realised that they couldn't work out how valuable it was to have an ad in printed media. They would always be taking a gamble. How many people read the advert? They have no real idea. People started to realise this when other ad streams appeared online. They could start to analyze their ads, and could positively tell how many people click on the link.</p>
<p>I dont read newspapers anymore. The question you need to ask is why? The answer is, half the time the newspapers have articles I dont care about, and the other half, I have already found out about somewhere else online.</p>

<p>This is a blindingly stupid perspective by a lawyer who knows nothing of the underlying economics of newspapers. </p>
<p>Journalist salaries are a minor component of the cost structure of operating a daily newspaper.</p>
<p>Most newspapers are still profitable today. Some of them are making 30 to 40 percent profit margins. </p>
<p>Where newspapers are taking a financial hit, it's coming from drops in classified advertising that would NOT be protected by any sort of copyright law changes, and from the demolition of locally owned advertisers by Wal-Mart and Best Buy. </p>
<p>Where newspaper OWNERS are in trouble, it's their own damned fault for gambling big with other people's money. It's not Google or blogs that created this mess, and killing the Internet will not fix anything.</p>

Your post worries me because I feel like you are acting atypically in taking a very strong stance on this subject with little knowledge about the subject matter and with heavy biases towards the status quo merely because they are already enfranchised and established entities.  I hope that you will re-consider your thoughts and continue to do research on the subject.  </p>
<p>This is an example: I came to this post via a link on a techcrunch article after reading a paraphrased version of your thoughts on techcrunch.  My presence (and others who are doing likewise) adds value to your site: a) if you had advertisements here people like me would click them, b) your reputation, your blogâs brand, and the memory of your arguments increases and becomes more popular with me and people I share you with, c) my comment actually adds value to you (increases likelihood of more visitors via search or links, and it also potentially helps achieve the goal of many blogs by challenging your opinions and making them more well-founded).  </p>
<p>Online traditional news sources (like nytimes.com) do everything they can to get people to link to their content.  To people who make a business on the web, links are described as "the currency of the web" and actually proprietize your content and extend its value across the web as opposed to devaluing it.  Look into the SEO industry, look into back-linking, there is a huge amount of information here that you should learn about before taking a stance as strong as you have about repealing fair use and standard practices in a new technology that actually greatly increases social value by its ability to take advantage of zero marginal costs.  </p>
<p>Sure the internet is a disruptive technology, and maybe perennial giants like the New York Times will have to change to survive as power is decentralized in the market to individuals via blogs and real-time news sources like twitter, but that doesnât mean that the government should step in and arbitrarily save the most profitable embodiment of traditional organs just because they are a more centralized / organized / traditional interest group.  They will survive, just in a more efficient / value-producing embodiment for society after they internalize the cost of finding this new embodiment (like every other company has to do in changing times).  This shift is inevitable no matter the government safeguards that are imposed.  The best way to increase the Good through changing times is to hold fast to our traditional values and to choose NOT to sacrifice them in cases of surprising new circumstancesâfrom the Patriot Bill to repealing standard copyright protections / free speech laws on the internet.</p>

<p>Newspapers solve a problem which now can be solved by the internet: distrution and content generation. Distribution can be done through a wire for relatively no cost, while content generation can be done by anyone. </p>
<p>Thus, saving the newspaper industry (=a problem solver for a problem which has become non-existant) is ludicrous. Why want anyone save analogue picture camera's while digital camera's are much better at solving the problem of making a picture?</p>
<p>Off course, Big Corp bosses at newspapers see their market plunge because of the internet. And they will do anything to defend their market, as any established business does. Here in The Netherlands, an internet tax was proposed by one of the most powerfull lobyists. The next day, this proposal was shot down in a blink by the secretary of media. This story illustrates how far off the current Big Corp. bosses are in line with reality.  Furthermore, it shows that Big Corp. bosses are desperate in trying anything to keep their revenue stream.</p>
<p>But since the problem the newspaper industry solves, effectively is become non-existant by the internet, the newspaper industry will die. Inevitably.</p>

<p>I am a creative artist and I'm a strong advocate of copyright protection. In fact I have recently turned to the courts for relief so this isn't a casual subject for me.</p>
<p>That being said, your advocating for new laws that would bar linking to a story is flawed.</p>
<p>Today any newspaper can prevent this in a hot minute. All they need to do is lock down their website and not allow ANYONE to view their content without being a subscriber.</p>
<p>Of course there is a downside to this: Google and other search engines would no longer 'see' the content and therefore the newspaper would become an invisible entity on the world wide web and that would be the inevitable consequence of such a law.</p>
<p>Linking to a site is not infringement - it is actually another signpost pointing people to that content and that is a very different situation of someone copying said content and posting it on their site. When someone clicks a link they LEAVE the originating site and literally go to the source - they are now ON THAT NEWSPAPERS website reading the article and the advertisements. This is a very positive force for the newspaper because they are being exposed to eyeballs that may never see that newspaper because they live in a different city or state.<br/>
Newspapers have some fundamental problems that are not caused by people linking to their websites. One major problem is that most newspapers just don't 'get' the web. They treat their website as if it were printed paper ignoring all the rich media that is available to the web browser.<br/>
I read that it costs the New York Times Company over $700 per subscriber to print and deliver the paper for one year. An Amazon Kindle is less that 1/2 that cost. Imagine: The NY Times could give every subscriber a Kindle and slash their costs in half and that's just the first year. <br/>
I am a newspaper subscriber and read a daily paper. I like holding them, folding them, tearing out articles or advertisements (and coupons), but I've also come to the realization that when I read my paper in the morning, aside from local news and obits, I've already read most of the articles ONLINE the night before.<br/>
I work out of my home, but if I had to commute by train, I ask myself, what would be easier: Reading a paper or a Kindle (or other electronic device)?<br/>
Newspapers must solve these issues in order to survive and search engines, blogs, or twitter posts linking to their content isn't hurting them, if anything it's keeping them on life-support.</p>

<p>Judge Posner, I know you're supposed to be one of the great legal minds of the century, so I'm loath to disagree with you. However, your idea of outlawing links to and paraphrasing of copyrighted material seems, well, silly. Hypertext links are probably the greatest invention of the Internet, and a fantastic way to enrich one's reading experience. If paper-based news disappears, it will be because of self-inflicted wounds, Craigslist, Google and Twitter, not hypertext links. We already have too many laws on the books outlawing too many innocent acts (witness RIAA's lawsuit for music sharing brought against a person who didn't even own a computer). By the way, I got to your blog through a link on TechCrunch (www.techcrunch.com), which had in turn been sent to my Kindle wirelessly. It is highly unlikely that I would have "heard" about your article any other way. I receive the San Francisco Chronicle and the New York Times l the same way, and I pay for them. I haven't stopped reading the news -- I've just changed the medium on which I read them. It's inevitable, and there's no point in trying to turn back the tide.</p>

<p>The major fixed costs of newspapers is not the salaries of journalists. Not even close. It's paper. Eliminate the cost of paper (and trucking and printing and marketing print subscriptions) and 3/4 of the cost of running a newspaper disappear. Online ad revenue, especially without the presence of the paper edition as competition, should suffice to keep most journalists employed --perhaps at lower salaries. Structural legacy issues stand in the way -- see my post at http://bit.ly/p4xcG for more details.</p>

<p>You sir are an idiot. If someone puts content online without restricting access to it and charging for it, they did it so anyone can read it. So what you are proposing then is akin to someone reading papers and not being allowed to tell anyone what they read, but refer others to read the paper and then they can perhaps discuss the news.</p>
<p>If a newspaper wants to charge for their content online, then they are welcome to do so. I doubt a majority will be paying to access the low quality of content and manufactured news these papers are trying to sell. What these dinosaurs with failing (or rather dying) business models (just like other media companies, like music and movie industry) have to realize is that rules of the game have changed, and individual people, bloggers and free thinkers around the world can offer just as much insight into world events as they happen as a paid reporter (often times even better actually). </p>

<p>You really need to re-read your history of mass communications, and in particular, pay attention to the penny press era as ushered in by James Gorden Bennett. Bennett correctly identified that the news distribution model of the day precluded efficient communication to the masses. Instead, the era was predominated by costly newspapers that required an annual subscription (paid in advance, often at the cost of 1/20th to 1/6 the annual wages of a common laborer).</p>
<p>Bennett innovated the replacement to this monolithic model with the penny press -- newspapers sold by street boys for a penny. Foregoing the certainty of a predictable pre-paid subscription base, he accessed new distribution means and utilized the concept of micropayments and advertising-dominated revenues.</p>
<p>A similar challenge faces the media today, but it has forgotten which business it is in. Indeed, while the New York Times could purchase Kindles for its entire subscriber base and more than pay for the expense in just one year by scrapping its monolithic carbon-consuming newsprinting plant, it has lost track of what it is in business to do. Instead, like GM and Chrysler, it is a provider of predictable employment to overpaid journalism school graduates and paper-moving union employees (as well as a perpetuity investment trust fund for certain family members).</p>
<p>Should we destroy the distribution of information and erect inane and unnatural copyright schemes to protect these inefficiencies? While it appears to be the popular regressionary tendencies of the Obama-supporting crowd, it will only enhance the disparity between economic reality and magnify the coming shock that the planned economy types who cease to reverse the flow of rivers will bear.</p>

<p>This is seriously crazy. I live in a country (not in the US, fortunately) where copyright is granted to every work automatically, including any web contents. Does that mean that all Americans are going to be barred from linking to any web page in my country? I doubt that anyone is going to ask for the right to link to a page, (presuming that each link to a page should require a separate permission).</p>
<p>Futhermore, are you going to bar all Americans from telling their friends that the newest issue of their favorite newspaper or journal has just arrived to the nearest library? Just to keep the "rights" of citizens balanced.</p>

<p>I think INS v. AP, 248 U.S. 215 (1918), contains some nuggets of wisdom for us on this issue.  Justices Holmes and Brandeis had a number of insightful things to say, but I think Brandeis's commentary on legislation to protect a property interest in news is more point:</p>
<p>"A Legislature, urged to enact a law by which one news agency or newspaper may prevent appropriation of the fruits of its labors by another, would consider such facts and possibilities and others which appropriate inquiry might disclose. Legislators might conclude that it was impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater than that sought to be remedied.  Or legislators dealing with the subject might conclude, that the right to news values should be protected to the extent of permitting recovery of damages for any unauthorized use, but that protection by injunction should be denied. . . .  If a Legislature concluded to recognize property in published news to the extent of permitting recovery at law, it might, with a view to making the remedy more certain and adequate, provide a fixed measure of damages, as in the case of copyright infringement.  </p>
<p>"Or again, a Legislature might conclude that it was unwise to recognize even so limited a property right in published news as that above indicated; but that a news agency should, on some conditions, be given full protection of its business; and to that end a remedy by injunction as well as one for damages should be granted, where news collected by it is gainfully used without permission. If a Legislature concluded that under certain circumstances news-gathering is a business affected with a public interest; it might declare that, in such cases, news should be protected against appropriation, only if the gatherer assumed the obligation of supplying it at resonable rates and without discrimination, to all papers which applied therefor. If legislators reached that conclusion, they would probably go further, and prescribe the conditions under which and the extent to which the protection should be afforded; and they might also provide the administrative machinery necessary for insuring to the public, the press, and the news agencies, full enjoyment of the rights so conferred."</p>
<p>I tend to agree with Brandeis's first comment, that it might be "impossible to put an end to the obvious injustice involved in such appropriation of news, without opening the door to other evils, greater than that sought to be remedied."  </p>
<p>I think any discussion of legislation on how to best protect the newspaper industry must be coupled with a discussion of why the newspaper industry - as it currently stands - needs to be protected.  Judge Posner's assertion - that the newspaper industry's decline means a reduction in the quality of reporting - is only clearly true with regard to newspaper reporting.  An exploration of whether non-newspaper reporting, especially such reporting that may only be possible through the internet, might be of sufficient quality, however that might be defined, ought to be conducted before asserting that a change in the law is desirable.</p>

<p>Why is there any social obligation to protect the written content of print and online journalism?</p>
<p>The judge is acknowledging that the purpose of Copyright is not to foster creativity, but to protect otherwise unworkable business models with state-sanctioned monopolies. The "marketplace of ideas" goes on without monolithic record companies and publishers.</p>
<p>We are undergoing a paradigm-shift in the nature of information and entertainment-delivery. Historically, monopolists suffer during such shifts and governments make hopeless attempts to protect and to perpetuate old and obsolete markets. This does little more than postpone the inevitable, giving robber barons time to perfect methods for stealing from the general population in the new markets.</p>
<p>I submit that it is better for society to let the markets play out without your intervention. Let rights-holders fail if they cannot market their wares without your help. You have recognized that Copyright does not exist to foster creativity or to enhance the "marketplace of ideas." Stop pandering to the monopolists.</p>

<p>Posner, I'm an old fart like you. Apparently, that's where the similarity ends. To begin with, I still have functioning grey cells.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I will try to explain: Hyperlinks are the web--they define it and distinguish it from every other medium. To put content on the web is to beg others to link to it. This is fundamental. Furthermore, to be useful, links need to be described; their existence must be justified. A link is an electronic citation and needs to contain enough material that the reader can make an intelligent decision to follow it or not.</p>
<p>The copyright "remedies" you seek are as unnecessary as they are thoughtless. Content owners already have the means to prevent any access they wish. They can keep their content off the web or restrict access to it using simple tools that are already available. </p>
<p>I'm afraid you've let your ignorance of the technology affect your judgement.<br/>

<p>I, like you, am concerned about the future of the newspaper industry, but do feel that the decline comes from a failure to adapt to and control associated new technologies. This failure is however not a recent one - the writing has been on the wall for the whole industry for a decade now. Technologies such as Social Media is simply accelerating this decline.</p>
<p>I can see the news on Twitter far faster than even the TV can report it. Twitter is like sitting next to an old Reuters news teletype of years gone by. As you correctly point out this is free.</p>
<p>The London Times has had for many years a paid subscription. If you pay your subscription then you can see every article that appears in the print edition plus additional, on-line only materials. This is one model that could be adopted by other newspapers.</p>
<p>Advertisers are currently perplexed about the future of advertising, not just the association with the print industry. However providing links to any site should benefit that site, I celebrate as I gain readership on my web-site, and my new readers come from my ability to be found and be relevant on searches. People come back to my site for my opinion (I know because I get thank you notes everyday by Twitter and email).</p>
<p>Your proposal to "Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent" is in my humble opinion wrong. Everything I produce is Copyright material - copyright attaches the moment I hit the publish button. If I bared links to my site I would limit traffic, which would not be to my benefit. It is not a case of a website taking a "free ride on other sites", linking is what drives traffic on the web. Google ranks pages in part because of linkages.</p>
<p>What you are witnessing is the democratisation of news. People have come to understand that when they observe something of significance their opinion is as important as that of a news reporter, even more so if they witnessed the actual event and can update the world through Twitter or other Social Media. They become the REAL reporter. Reuters and the Associated Press can NEVER again become the only professional, non-governmental sources of news and opinion.</p>
<p>As a lawyer I do support copyright law very strongly, as a technologist I support an expansion of access to materials. As an author I support payment for effort made. The fact that material exists on the web does prohibit it from being provided as a cost. Perhaps the subscription model should be considered further for many content providers, including the traditional print media.</p>

<p>Mark Lemley, a Stanford Law professor, has written extensively on the free-rider issue as relates to copyright.  In particular, his paper "Property, Intellectual Property, and Free Riding" (), specifically discusses how applying the traditional concept of property rights to "intellectual property" can actually be detrimental to society as a whole, because some of the assumptions used break down when applied to a non-rivalrous good.</p>

<p>Technically, every web page is a copyrighted publication. Banning links without permission would effectively break the web. Most websites welcome links from other websites and would not want to have the access to their website hindered by your misunderstanding of fair use.</p>

<p>"Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, might be necessary to keep free riding on content financed by online newspapers from so impairing the incentive to create costly news-gathering operations that news services like Reuters and the Associated Press would become the only professional, nongovernmental sources of news and opinion."</p>
<p>We only grant the authority to secure copyright and other temporary monopolies on creative work under the required condition that it promotes progress.</p>
<p>While I follow the reasoning of how this proposal may promote "professional nongovernmental sources of news and opinion", it is not at all obvious to me that this is progress.</p>
<p>If previous experience in matters involving unbalanced enforcement of the claims of buggy-whip manufacturer associations is any indication, such a proposal would be more likely to promote *unlawful* "nongovernmental sources of news and opinion" than legitimate/professional offerings.<br/>

<p>The Internet has been great at leveling the playing field for a good many folk.</p>
<p>There are a good many industries that will never be the same.</p>
<p>Recording Industry<br/>
Movie Industry<br/>
Telecommunications Industry<br/>
Software Industry</p>
<p>Elections will never be the same.</p>
<p>We no longer develop film or use electronic tape media for family pictures or videos.  We don't pass around physical photographs.</p>
<p>The way we work with one another and produce work product will never be the same.</p>
<p>Why do you, or anyone else believe that the newspaper industry should be sacred?</p>
<p>Why the judicial activism to save the newspaper industry by way of legislation?  Which by the way is the business of the legislative branch, not the judicial branch.  </p>
<p>Most of us would have preferred that the government let GM and Chrysler die for not paying attention to the wants, needs, and desires of the consumers.  If they can't make a product that we can buy and want to buy, then why keep the company alive?  And, don't say the unions.</p>
<p>So goes the newspaper industry.  If they can't learn, adapt, and produce content in a manner that keeps the bills paid, and produces something worthwhile to read that someone would want, then maybe they should go under.  </p>
<p>Maybe then, when people buy up reputable newspapers in an effort to control the media bias to which the readers are exposed, it will be a good deal more transparent.</p>

<p>I saw the following quote in the TechCrunch blog at http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/06/28/how-to-save-the-newspapers-vol-xii-outlaw-linking/ </p>
<blockquote>Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holderâs consent, or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holderâs consent . . .</blockquote>
<p>I like to check original sources. </p>
<p>If I had not seen the TechCrunch blog with this quote, I would not have known about Judge Posner's blog (and bookmarked it). </p>
<p>If TechCrunch had not quoted from Judge Posner, then I doubt that I would have paid much attention to the TechCrunch post. </p>
<p>In other words - the quote got me to the source. I will now read the source. Bar bloggers from quoting and I wonder how others would get noticed?</p>
<p>One solution would be to use change Copyright Law so that a writer would have to say Copyright expressly. Everything else would be like Copyleft is trying to be; or like the Creative Commons Share and Share Alike license at http://creativecommons.org/license/</p>
<p>That way newspapers would automatically be allowing complete sharing unless they expressly copyright an article.</p>
<p>Let's see what happens to their revenue if the copyright everything. Or, as some newspapers do now, lead you to their site and let you read the lead paragraph and then have to register to read the full article. I predict even less traffic and then less advertising revenue.</p>

<p>The Internet is a public medium. If a copyright owner publicly displays their copyrighted work, they are implicitly authorizing public access to that work.</p>
<p>The World Wide Web--the set of technologies which most people believe constitutes "The Internet"--is based on principles of distribution and connectivity. Content is hosted on disparate systems and connected via hyperlinks.</p>
<p>All works, unless explicitly placed in the public domain, carry an implied copyright. If copyright law forbade the World Wide Web from linking to copyrighted works, the World Wide Web itself would cease to function. The disparate systems that constitute the World Wide Web would no longer be allowed to link to each other.</p>
<p>The simplest solution, one that is used by many news organizations today, is to control access to the system hosting the copyrighted works.</p>

<p>Just my $.02:  The most egregious part of the opinion asserts that linking and paraphrasing should be barred.  In fact, paraphrasing with a link to the original, full story, drives traffic to the news site and increases their views.  If the link is to a portal login, that encourages readers to subscribe, again increasing revenue for the news site.  I have a blog that I've maintained since before the word "blog" was created, and I often highlight a news story, with a link to the original story, when writing up my opinions.  I highly doubt I've discouraged readers from seeking more details about the news story.</p>

<p>Extend copyright law to prohibit linking to newspaper materials?  I respectfully beg to differ.  Newspapers themselves can prevent external linking quite simply by using a paywall:  inbound links yield a polite reminder that the linked material is available only to paying subscribers.<br/>
And I cannot agree that the democratizing effect of the Internet will result in a dearth of good writing.  <br/>
There will be - has been in fact - an explosion of creative activity and writing of all kinds as ordinary people have the means to publish, formerly the exclusive province of those who had access to publishing apparatus, like the newspapers.<br/>
The result will not be a decline in the quality of writing, but a great expansion in the amount of written material.  Certainly a great deal of the material will be drivel.  But ultimately the explosion of writing generally will result in a greater, not a lesser, volume of good writing.  To be sure it will also result in an increased volume of bad writing, and the size of the haystack will arguably make it more difficult to find the needles of good writing therein, but the net volume of needles will increase as the newspapers and old-line publishers lose control of who publishes.<br/>
The proffered solution - expanding copyright to prohibit linking to copyrighted material, is an uninformed, shortsighted and ultimately futile proposition to provide life support for a moribund business model and satisfy the hegemonic pretensions of a heretofore unchallenged oligarchy of print publishers.<br/>
The proverbial genie is already out of the bottle.  Judge Posner's eyes, firmly fixed on the rear view mirror, cannot see the plethora of new mammalian business models that already have made obsolete the dinosaurs of the oldline publishing cartels.<br/>
The new media mammals are too small, nimble and numerous to stop now.  The old media dinosaurs are doomed, and the sclerotic, backward ramblings of even so esteemed a jurist as Judge Posner are purest vanity.<br/>

<p>Newspapers are dying because Americans (sadly) would rather be entertained than informed.  Newspapers long ago shifted their emphasis from reporting serious "news" (objective fact) to providing entertainment (political bias, scandal, shock, lifestyle extremism, etc.). They succeeded in "dumbing down" their audiences and are now paying the price as their bored readers move on. Network news is suffering a similar fate, and I predict talk radio will someday run its course and decline. </p>

<p>Other commenters have already mentioned many of the concerns that I have about the proposed approach.  To address one particular point, however: why on earth would you even think about preventing the linking of public material?  Linking material from other sites allows sites to direct their own readers to the sources of the information - readers who then increase advertising revenue!  Likewise with paraphrasing, which in conjunction with a link is equivalent to free advertising for the news source.</p>
<p>Your proposed restrictions on material that's been publicly placed on the internet would have the exact opposite of the effect your reasoning attempts to achieve.  The newspapers have already made quite enough of an attempt to kill their golden goose, without the bureaucratic mess this would create.</p>

<p>Intriguing ... This is the first time that I have ever heard or seen that "Freedom of Speech" somehow grants a privilege or right to the free use of Intellectual Property. Perhaps this is due to fact that the Internet has been allowed for so long to operate in a free-wheeling and anarchic mode that it's users no longer think in terms of Intellectual Private Property. That is, the well developed legal areas of Patent, Trademark and Copyright. The Western Portion of the World is where this form,thinking and body of law is fairly well developed. Asia is a different story.</p>
<p>All of this kind of reminds me of an inverted legal structure where "Liberty is not License", but "License is Liberty". Perhaps this explains why; Plagarism, Piracy and outright Theft is the norm of the day on the Internet.</p>
<p>Copyright? It does appear that the Internet and the WWW must somehow be taken underwing and made to toe the line.    </p>

<p>The law already bars online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent. Setting up a website to restrict access to materials is really no more or less difficult than setting up a website in the first place. In fact, the New York Times does this today (they force you to register in order to get access to the majority of their website). Any attempt to circumvent the protections set up by the Times is a violation of the DMCA. If a page on their website is accessible without registration, it is only because they have allowed the page to be freely accessible. They can even allow a page to be freely accessible one day and restrict access the next, something that is pretty much impossible to do with a physical copy.</p>
<p>Linking really is nothing more or less than a citation that, through the wonder of modern technology, allows the viewer to request a copy of the original referenced material simply by clicking on the link. There is nothing that compels the original provider to respond to the request, or to do so without additional restrictions. The New York Times, again, usually requires the requester to register with the site before it will honor the request. Admittedly, one can get to some pages on their site without registering, but only because they have explicitly allowed this occur. </p>
<p>As to making paraphrasing illegal â from whom did you ask permission to paraphrase the Warren Buffett quote, or to restate the amount by which ad revenues for newspapers fell in 2007? Would these bits of information be examples of unlawful paraphrasing without permission under your proposed changes? Can you really imagine being able to write any topical blog post if one had to obtain permission for every published fact that was paraphrased from a copyrighted article? Perhaps you mean only to restrict the wholesale rewriting of entire articles. I don't see any reason why this should be any more or less legal than it is in the physical world of ink on paper, and I can assure you that if I were to publish a paper or online edition of a paraphrasing of one of the Harry Potter series I would be on the losing end of a very expensive lawsuit.<br/>
<br/>
Unless you mean to make it illegal to quote anything without permission, or to extend copyright to cover to the facts themselves, not just the particular expression of those facts, everything you have suggested is already restricted by law or is already under the complete control of the publisher. The newspapers are in the unenviable position that the town criers of old found themselves in when the ability to read became commonplace â they no longer control the most efficient and convenient means of communicating information to the majority of people. They need to adapt, or figuratively, get the town council to âoutlaw reading,â if they are to survive. One hopes that those playing the role of the town council are wise enough to realize that the ability to read serves the needs of more people than does saving the job of the town crier.<br/>

<p>It is trivial to prevent anyone linking to your copyright content. You simply don't post it online for everyone to see, and you make people pay to see it. </p>
<p>Oh, but that business model does not work either. So, what is the solution? Well, you buy an influential politician to lobby for a ridiculous law to protect and defend your dying business model, just like the media companies.</p>

<p>Doesn't anyone realize that linking to content may actually drive MORE readers to the article than  not? </p>
<p>You don't *get* how the internet changes how we access data. Numerous search engines provide facilities to generate custom news feeds based on interests regardless of source. This is a good thing. I may not read some news paper, but if an article pops on my feed, I might. Especially if it has an interesting teaser.</p>
<p>People who aggregate news headlines, decks, and links, or write commentary to a news article providing a link to the original story are inviting their visitors to visit the original site.</p>
<p>News papers should want to get on search engine listings and should want to let others link to stories. If the newspaper wants to charge for access, then gate the site (it's not that hard to do) and let's see how much revenue you generate. </p>
<p>No news papers have to figure out a new business model--provide something unique that visitors will want to view. </p>

<p>One word: proportionality.</p>
<p>Even if this were the only way to save the newspaper industry, it would be too high a price.</p>
<p>Locking up text for over a century is bad enough, but at least the damage is mostly limited to the 'creative' sector.</p>
<p>Lock up facts for a similar period and you send us back to the situation we had in the middle ages, except instead of guilds controlling knowledge it would be corporations.</p>
<p>As for forbidding us to link to (ie. cite) copyright material, that's how the web works.  Almost everything is copyright, so if you forbid linking then you destroy the web.</p>
<p>(Besides, anyone who really doesn't want their pages linked to from outside their website can very easily achieve that by technical means.  New laws are not required.  Of course if you do that, don't be surprised if your site gets little traffic.  I found this blog via a third-party link.)<br/>

<p>I've been reading the Becker-Posner blog for a very long time, and while I've often read things here that I've disagreed with, this is the first time that I've felt particularly uncomfortable with anything posted here.</p>
<p>Others far better than I have highlighted the fallacies and flaws in your argument, Judge Posner. However, I must add that it almost seems surreal that a great legal mind such as yours has such a limited grasp of technology, and would suggest something that goes against the very fundamental nature of the Internet, and more importantly, free speech.</p>
<p>Our freedom of speech is not going to die at the hands of the government -- it is going to be at the hands of the media cartels and copyright czars, aided by folks such as yourself. The road to hell, as they say, is paved with good intentions.</p>
<p>The idea behind a disruptive technology is that it is disruptive. You can try to stop its march the same way defenders of horse buggies rallied against the rise of the first motorcars - but we all know how that ended. This is the same tactic that folks like the RIAA employ to stop technologies from spreading, but get this - information wants to be free. You can try restricting it, you can try to draft laws to stop it from reaching the intended audience and you can be afraid of it. But no matter what you do, there is no denying the fact that there will always be workarounds. This fundamental and inalienable truth is something that folks have time and again failed to grasp, and it is almost saddening to see you, Judge Posner, fall into the same trap. </p>
<p>Trying to twist existing laws to help such corporations survive is laughable - and I would be laughing hard, if it were not coming from a legal emeritus such as yourself. In this case, I am shocked and saddened by your lack of understanding in grasping the very technology that powers your blog.</p>
<p>Newspapers are struggling and the fourth estate is hitting a hard spot? Well, tough luck. It is not the duty of the government to determine what companies live on and what do not. If their business model is flawed, well then it is quite unfortunate for them. </p>
<p>But more importantly, I see this as an opportunity for citizen bloggers and amateur journalists to step in. It is already happening, across the world. And it is only a matter of time before it becomes more widespread. The best thing about the Internet is that it empowers people. By trying to maliciously enforce copyright laws (which are in themselves quite antiquated) in ways that go against the very fundamental idea of free speech, you are trying to take away that empowerment.</p>
<p>If the big corporate newspapers die, then citizen Joe will have the power to be a journalist. Why should only people from AP and Reuters get Press badges to be at a White House conference? Why can't bloggers and individuals who want to pursue journalism do the same thing? If anything, I find this to be a great way to level the playing field in favor of individuals.</p>
<p>Yes, please go ahead and spread the idiocy of copyright laws even more - and we, sir, will fight tooth and nail to let information be free for all to use. Copyleft, Judge Posner, is here to stay.</p>

<p>Information is only valuable if it can be used for some purpose.  Most of the news that I read is little more than entertainment to be read in between bites at some meal.  If the news was not available online for no more cost that the time it takes to load a page and the cost the ISP requires, I'd do what I did in the days BEFORE the internet: read a book or watch TV.  And TV was free - the three or four channels that came on those rabbit ears.</p>
<p>As to information that is useful for doing or making things:  that still requires payment - most research journals require a subscription.  Patents can be searched, but downloads cost money.  ASTM standards are the same.  Consumer reports is the same.  </p>
<p>Perhaps it is because so many newspapers carry generic "national and world" news that can be had from dozens of well known news sources, that management has forgotten that it is the uniqueness of the news that provided that information with value.  Everyone is talking about the recent death of Michael Jackson - so how valuable is a NY Times article on his death?  CNN will likely scoop the printed newspapers on breaking news, so why bother printing much about it?</p>
<p>My local newspaper prints news that can't be found anywhere else on the web or in print.  No one else in the world cares.  The folks in the next city don't care.  Yet this local paper insists upon publishing the whole newspaper for FREE on the Web.  Why should I subscribe?  Would you pay for shoes you could get for free?  From the same vender?</p>
<p>The local news, which requires that someone go to all of the council meetings, track down things at the local court house, etc., is valuable because it helps me as someone who lives there to know what is going on in my region.  That is worth money.  </p>
<p>One of the issues with Newspapers is debt, which I don't see mentioned.  Sure subscriptions are down, but many of the newspapers borrowed a lot of money to buy other newspapers.  Mergers like this help bankers get rich but usually cost jobs and corporate value.  </p>

<p>Distribution of hardcopy is the reason why newspapers cost money.  Subscription fees and the 50 cents we place in newspaper machines pay for the drivers who deliver our papers.  It pays for the paper the news is printed on.  It pays for the ink the paper is printed with.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Advertising revenue pays for the salaries of journalists and editors.  It also pays for the cameras for photographers and the computers for the layout department.  Advertising revenue does not come from subscriptions -- it comes from advertisers.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
This is why there are numerous "free" newspapers in many large (and sometimes small) cities.  For instance, in Athens, Georgia, there are two significant free newspapers.  One is the Red &amp; Black (and independent, daily student newspaper of fairly good quality) and Flagpole (a once-weekly arts and culture paper).<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
These "free" newspapers are able to afford this business model because they gain revenue from advertising.  Their journalists are paid from this advertising revenue, as are their distributors.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
This is not to say these free newspapers will or can replace larger newspapers.  As good as the Red &amp; Black student newspaper is, their reporters have no foreign bureaus.  Similarly, Flagpole functions primarily based on part-time authors or even gratis pieces.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Rather, these free newspapers point out the flaw in newspaper thinking that the internet has broken their model.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
The internet has made the model more competitive, not broken it.  Regional barriers newspapers could rely upon are now non-existant.  The Rocky Mountain news now had to compete with the likes of the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the New York Times.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
The newspaper industry is facing the classic forms of creative destruction that free market capitalism provides.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Papers must now innovate and compete much more fiercely to survive.  Stories must be better presented, better written, and more interesting or else readers of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution will now turn to the Chicago Tribune or the New York Times, and vice-versa.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
This is not a bad thing.  This is not a good thing.  This is an economic thing.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
The free-riding solution Mr. Posner recommends is questionable.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
First, free riding is not currently legal.  I can not start a blog that consists of content directly lifted from the Associated Press.  This violates even the thin copyright protections granted to the Associated Press in covering fact-based events.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Since free loading is currently illegal, the only problem with it must be the inability for it to be enforced.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Adding an additional layer of copyright on top of the already-violated copyright does nothing to solve the enforcement problem.  If free loading is already difficult to enforce, so will banning links to copyrighted material.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
This solution provides no new tools to a copyright holder's arsenal.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Finally, back to the final point about online-based newspapers not being able to secure a brick-and-mortar organization of the scale of the current New York Times -- nonsense.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Sure, this can not be done right now.  Nevertheless, advertising revenue from online sources is beginning to catch up with traditional media.  For instance, recent reports indicate Hulu advertisements now cost more per minute than TV advertisements for some programs.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
There will be a time when news organizations will be able to leverage new technology to reduce overhead and still create slick, intelligent, and well-written news articles we expect (but sometimes seldom receive) from newspapers.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Free market capitalism is fraught with creative destruction.  Unfortunately for newspapers, some of this destruction is ruining their bottom line and, in more and more cases, putting them out of business.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Even so, more and more papers are stepping up to the challenge to be creative.  The Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal lead the way.<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
The question is, truly, whether we should cease trusting in the efficiency of competitive markets to bring consumers the best product, or should we attempt to prop up dying and inefficient business models?<br/>
<br/><br/><br/>
Sincerely,<br/><br/>
John</p>

<p>A few people challenged Judge Posner's assertion that most of the costs for a newspaper are salaries. This was not at all the conclusion of a recent Moody's report which puts that cost at merely 14%:</p>
<p>http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003980461</p>
<p>According to a 2007 report in Newspaper Research Journal, advertising (display and classified) amounted to approximately 70-80% of newspaper revenue.  Thus, newspapers have actually more or less given away their content for years.</p>
<p>There are lots of deep changes which challenge newspapers. For starters, it is difficult for a local newspaper to distinguish itself in covering national and international topics, and this is as much a factor of cable television as it is the internet. (And note, most of what people see on cable TV is "free" too, as much as internet news is.)</p>
<p>The other thing is that advertisers expect more bang for their buck. Newspaper advertising was probably never influencing as many consumers as ad sales people claimed it was, and now that manufacturers can strike national deals to get better shelf placement, they are probably more critical of the value of a big splashy buy.</p>
<p>Thanks to all for the stimulating discussion in the comments.</p>

<p>There is no loss to society merely from getting rid of the newspaper.</p>
<p>There already is in depth investigative journalism on the net, although on the net things are just faster. Journalists could embrace that but they don't, which is not our problem.</p>
<p>Requiring people to compensate for a news article is not only absurd but stifling of communication and a blatant attack on the first amendment.  Do newspaper companies pay the people who provide their stories? Does TV news pay newspapers for the stories they cover? No, they don't. Neither should the internet community at large.</p>
<p>Please look at your argument from a global perspective and then the savings should be more apparent, Judge.</p>

<p>This article is really misinformed, or is trying to bend the reality to represent itsâ point of view. It is not only me, online nobody, who thinks so, but Graydon Carter of Vanity Fair, who in his Editorâs Letter from July 2009 (also available online, go figure, at http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/07/graydon200907 ) explains really simply, there is no value for me in reading the news papers today. It is the quality that is missing from todayâs news papers.</p>
<p>Quite the opposite of what you have put forward, online media does not leech of print media. There was a great gag the Daily Show did, when they ask NYT editor to point to one thing in the pile of newspapers at his desk that happened on that day. Editor said he could not. That is the point. There is no reason for online experts to leech of print papers. Print papers are slow and not really of any relevance in todayâs world. Just ask Barack Obama, who will rather use the Huffington Post, then the NYT. The NYT will leech of the Huffington Post, and that is a fact.</p>

<p>What's a local newspaper anyway?  Mostly local ads, ham-handed human interest stories, obituaries, editorials little better than blog posts, high school and college sports, and a ton of syndicated world/national news and features (comics pages, advice columns, etc.).  So most of the content creation at the local level yields basically junk not worth propping up.</p>
<p>Why should we be in a twist over whether the local sports desk can continue to operate at a loss?  If they're losing money, it's primarily because they were never good in the first place and merely benefited from a relatively captive local audience.  They need to fail.  </p>
<p>There might a role for subsidized/protected news outlets (e.g. PBS; cf. the BBC), but there's no place in this country for limiting the rights of citizens to tell other people what has been published by linking to it.</p>

<p>Wow, I couldn't disagree with you more. Links help drive traffic to newspapers and increase, not decrease, revenue. The more links a site has, the more valuable it is and the higher it places in search engine rankings. The only way you make money online is by way of traffic. Make linking illegal and you will kill traffic and the papers with it. I'm a little shocked you have come to this conclusion. Please reconsider. </p>

<p>Barring linking to copyrighted material is pretty much the same as barring linking in general, given that everything is copyrighted, even if most of us don't bother to register the copyrights.  That would destroy the web.  That's not a good thing.</p>
<p>Newspapers are middlemen.  There's no shortage of news gatherers (as I think events in Iran have shown).  Middle men, like newspapers and record labels, are fast becoming unnecessary now that they're less efficient than their competitors.</p>

<p>Why do people assume if you don't pay for access to something, it is free? It should be obvious that we all pay for "free-tv", "free" news sites and other ad-supported things when we buy the products that are advertised there.</p>
<p>When you pay directly for access, you have a choice. When you think it's free, they have already made you pay. And then you pay, even if you don't visit! It's effectively a private tax. The only way to not pay it is to watch for ads and then not buy what is advertised - seems unpractical.</p>

<p>The fundamental concern is not whether newspapers survive or not, but will the democracy survive. A lot of what fills newspapers, TV news, etc is just junk with respect to enabling a democracy. One should start by looking at the fundamental concern of maintaining watchdogs over powerful groups.</p>
<p>Also of first concern is increasing the number of people who reject junk news or news as entertainment and look to inform themselves in ways that increase their ability to be citizens.</p>
<p>I welcome the demise of the newspapers, if it allows us to rethink the true purpose of news and come up with better ways of maintaining a democracy. There have been so few things tried, but folks are working on it, and if you look about while keeping the fundamentals of democracy in mind, the possibilities dilate.</p>

<p>There is no way to get around the fact that newspapers are ancient in the digital world. It isn't simply that people can't afford to subscribe to newspapers anymore, it is that they don't want to because the news from organizations like Reuters is as-it-happens in most cases. Take the death of Michael Jackson as a perfect example. The public wanted the updates as they occured and the only source for that information is online. It wasn't on CNN and it definitely wasn't in any newspapers.</p>

<p>I was wondering why the newspapers are in such a steep decline but now I know - it is old guys like you two that have no clue about technology or the internet. Seriously you're discussing technology that is probably 50-60 years younger than you, do you really think you have a clue?</p>
<p>Have either or both of you ever:<br/>
1. Used facebook?<br/>
2. Used Firefox as a browser?<br/>
3. Used Thunderbird or another open source email client?<br/>
4. Gained any understanding of open source?<br/>
5. Used Myspace?<br/>
6. Used Linux?<br/>
7. Read good articles and opposing (and non-antagonistic) views on the newspaper industry on other blogs? Matt Asay and Scott Rosenberg come to mind.<br/>
8. Used Skype?<br/>
9. Spent hours and hours at a time trawling the internet for information or even just for entertainment?<br/>
10. Do you know how to use iTunes?<br/>
11. Do you own and use (for the internet) a smart phone like the iPhone?<br/>
12. Have you ever used a netbook?</p>
<p>The last paragraph beautifully demonstrates to me why your industry will not survive. First you assume that no one else is able to provide good content or news. This is itself fascinating and second you assume that this archaic business model of yours is suitable for every age. You are wrong on both counts.</p>
<p>It is not the economy that has spoken it is your consumers. If you cannot believe your consumers or if you think they're lying to you then you're in serious trouble.</p>
<p>This massive plummet is the industry being hit by the clue train and the clue is: Your business model is not suited to the 21st century. Are you going to change or fight it until you have nothing left?</p>
<p>Good luck with that.</p>
<p>I am not gloating or hoping for the industry to fail my main emotion relevant to this whole crash is complete shock and surprise that the industry so far is completely unable to respond in a viable fashion. All I see is a bunch of grey haired old guys that are totally out of their depth.</p>

<p>I'd just like to point out a couple of things about "linking" that the author of this blog doesn't seem to understand. </p>
<p>I have a blog. If I read an interesting story on the news, and I link to it, all I'm doing is telling my friends "go read this story; it's interesting". If they click the link, they end up at the newspaper's web site, and they read their story and see their ads. By linking to the story, I've done the newspaper a FAVOR. I've driven a new customer to their site. </p>
<p>Obviously linking (and paraphrasing part of the source story in order to discuss it) is legally protected FAIR USE. This SHOULD go without saying. </p>
<p>But it's more important to understand what linking actually represents. It's one reader saying to a potential reader "Hey, I read a great article at the WSJ today; you should check it out". He's not stealing anything. He's not giving the potential reader a free ride.  He's just saying "go check out the WSJ today".  </p>
<p>You'd think they'd WANT that to happen, wouldn't you?  </p>
<p>Instead of complaining about it, and suggesting such behavior should he outlawed (ha!), you should be ENCOURAGING it. You should consider linking to be a way to SAVE newspapers -- by making them more relevant to more people. </p>
<p>Every link drives traffic to a newspaper's site.  Just like a Google search drives traffic to a newspaper's old articles. </p>

<p>Journalist need to strike out on there own, and free themselves from the tyranny of the classic news outlets. In stead of putting our trust in the NYTs or Washington Post or whatever, we will look to individuals who gain our trust. In fact, we need only look to folks like Richard Stallman who survived putting out free content to show it is very doable. Without doubt there will be analogues in journalism; they are among us now.</p>
<p>Don't agonize over the dying news outlets; instead, look to increase privacy rights of individuals, transparency of government and big business. Enable people to anonymously leak info from within government, etc. Get people to use strong encryption in day to day communications, and so on.<br/>

<p>The question is how to fight terrorism, right? Isn't it all the same phenomenon? We fixate on the federal government, on the world report. Whoever can generate to most shocking story gets the all eyeballs, and so the local news report dies because everyone can dial up the same web page from any point in the world (well, at least the kids in China and Iran and Australia can get CNN). So how do we make local  news more compelling? For starters, give local governments more control over their own lives. Anything that the the states can do, they should do: education, marriage, drug regulation, abortion, and so forth. Get the federal government out of this stuff, and people will all of sudden start taking a big interest in local politics, and then there will be a need and desire for reporters on this level. </p>

<p>this article, and so many others like it, misses the point entirely. it begins with the perspective of "we have this large newsgathering staff, we must find a way to be compensated for our work. ... we must find a way to charge for content! we must find a way to protect the value of the content we produce!"</p>
<p>Um, why? Why not start with economic reality as it is, and try to build a business that makes sense in the current environment, rather than starting with a business that used to make sense and trying to rationalized it, protect it, or save it?</p>

<p>So because blogs are generating hits and advertising revenue for online publishers, they're getting a "free ride?" I doubt the newspapers see it that way. If the blogs or the forums are what have the eyes on them, and they link to another source of news - which is typically done without compensation - then the news sources should thank their lucky stars that they have folks willing to fill their pockets.</p>

<p>Isn't Posner a lawyer? How could a linking ban possibly hold up? All a link is is an accelerated way to say where something is located. To outlaw it would be like outlawing a statement such as "Madison Square Garden is on Seventh Avenue" or, perhaps more to the point, "You'll find 'A Catcher in the Rye" under the "S"es. A url is a location; it is not content.</p>

<p>"We rarely meet a man who can tell us any news which he has not read in a newspaper, or been told by his neighbor; and, for the most part, the only difference between us and our fellow is, that he has seen the newspaper, or been out to tea, and we have not.

<p>Suppose that a law is passed banning links without express permission. The internet's reaction will probably be to define a tag to be placed in robots.txt, for example, that affirms that the website owner gives blanket permission for links. The search sites will probably ignore any site that does not have the tag. Within three days everything will be back to normal, with a minor interruption caused by everyone having to modify their websites to include the tag. Those that don't will see their traffic drop to zero, which really will put them out of business. </p>

<p>Are you on drugs or what? Hyperlinks to other content are a fundamental feature of the web. You cannot simply ban this. Copyright law is crazy enough as it is - please don't make it any worse. And in case you hadn't noticed, you have ZERO right to regulate things on the internet, as it isn't American in any way (and thank God for that). Please retire or try to live in the 21st century for a change. Newspapers (like everyone else) will have to adapt to new technology. This has always been the case. They are making way too much money as it is, so I don't really feel sorry for them. By the way, I thought this was the point of the free market - to let things fail when better alternatives pop up.</p>

<p>Richard, I'd like to discuss the points you make more, but I fear in order to do so, I'd need to paraphrase some of your points and link to your post in violation of your proposed new copyright laws. Your writings here, after all, are protected by copyright.</p>
<p>I'd also like to read more quality news, but I fear what happens when your digital barrier enters the real world. Papers commonly report what's discovered by other papers. Will they be forbidden from doing so?</p>
<p>I'd also like to find relevant content from across the web -- not just news content but any content. But if search engines are unable to link to this content, I fear I'll no longer be able to do so. Either will those in the legal profession.</p>
<p>We have copyright laws already. Many of those seem sufficient without issuing a special pardon to them for newspapers.</p>

<p>One comment on controlling linking to content: "Expanding copyright law to bar telling people where a newspaper article was published or paraphrasing that article might be necessary to prevent free riding.". Phrased like that, the problem becomes obvious: keeping anybody from telling anyone else that you published something is <i>not</i> a good way to gain readers. In fact it's more likely to cost you readers.</p>
<p>Now, verbatim copying of an entire story is obviously a problem, but one doesn't need to talk about linking to deal with that. Copyright law already handles that, the only thing needed is to clarify that what's being addressed is the presentation to the user, not the underlying HTML code. If someone copies a story by making an IFRAME that sources the text from the original site while making it appear to be present on the copying site, that ought to be as much copying as copy-and-pasting the text itself. But simply providing a link to the story is a different matter.</p>
<p>Of course, I've had reason in the past to make verbatim copies. Publications change their stories all the time. Dead-tree publications I can just clip the original story out and have a record of what they originally published even if they change it later. But how do I do that with on-line publications? I've several times made comments about an on-line story only to have that story changed later and people call me out for making false representations about what the story said, and the only thing that protected me was that I had a time-stamped verbatim copy of the story as originally published. When doing commentary on an article, the whole issue of having the article change after the fact and preserving the change history so it's clear what the article said when you commented on it and what changes were made after your commentary is a fairly significant issue. One that's embarrassing to the original publishers a fair percentage of the time.</p>

<p>Finally, somebody talking sense. People who think charging for online content or barring linking is a crazy stupid idea, ask yourself this: how many people do you know who take a hard copy of a magazine, say Rolling Stone, and re-type all those stories and email them to their friends, or go and make copies of stories to mass distribute and re-package with their own ads?  This is what many blogs are doing. They're back-dooring their way into paid models and the bloggers and aggregators think it is their right to be able to do so, when really it's akin to stealing. I've been saying this since Day 1. Newspapers continue to see a drop in their content's value because they continue to give it away for free online. Charge something - ANYTHING, 10 cents a week, for all I care - to give it SOME value, and quit letting people rip off your work free of charge.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the best solution to deal with competition is to eliminate competition.</p>
<p>Asking legislators to come in and restrict the Fair Use Act, which is exactly what you're looking for, is akin to Coca-Cola lobbying Congress to ban Pepsi from making any drink that is made with carbonated syrup.</p>
<p>Maybe newspapers need to spend less time whining about the competition, and spending more time ACTUALLY competing. </p>
<p>There are ways to make print products valuable without worrying about "stale" news. Create a system where the print product has ORIGINAL material, and stop offering that original material for free on the Internet. </p>
<p>Bloggers are more apt to link to something they have free access to than something they have to pay for, or to type out of the newspaper. </p>
<p>Also, this column fails to address is how much traffic this might generate for news outlets online, and thus push up CPM rates. If a reporter has a story that draws a lot of attention from online news outlets, they are getting publicity -- and traffic -- to that story.</p>

<p>I feel this article has misdiagnosed the problem, and therefore ends up positing an inappropriate solution.</p>
<p>Others above have very clearly stated that the internet IS the collection of linked pages....if we destroy the means to link, then the internet is no longer the internet.  Changing laws to protect a dying business model is not the way to proceed.</p>
<p>I obtain a large amount of my news from blogs where people post links to interesting stories they have found online.  If I find the summary (typically paraphrased from the original content) interesting, I follow the link to the original content and read it there.  On a good day, I might read news from 1-2 dozen different news providers, many of which I couldn't possibly obtain in print form at all (or certainly not in any time frame for the content to be relevant).  The content providers I visit (some are reputable news sources such as well-regarded newspaper and magazines, others are "some guy's blog") typically generate revenue through ad click-through, or paid ads on their sites, which I view much the same as I would in dead-tree form.</p>
<p>I have paid for online news content.  I have paid for online subscriptions.  I have paid to have dead-tree copies of things sent to my home.  If newspapers want to remain viable, it is time for them to consider what service(s) they really provide, and how best to provide them in a manner which will generate revenue.  As an example, removing the New York Times from the internet does not mean I will start reading the dead-tree version, I cannot obtain it here.  I am happy to view their content (and therefore contribute somehow to their financial well-being by viewing their ads) online.</p>
<p>By the way, I found this blog through a link at www.Groklaw.net.  While I disagree, I am glad to have found it.  If linking/paraphrasing were not allowed, I would never have seen it at all.</p>

<p>Yes, to continue the Thoreau thread:"The news we hear, for the most part, is not news to our genius. It is the stalest repetition....Read not the Times. Read the Eternities."</p>
<p>There is a large market for say a weekly or monthly or perhaps biyearly "newspaper" that would allow those who wanted to stay informed, that don't want to be caught with their pants down; but also don't want to put up with "stale news." If it is not important after a week, was it ever really important in the first place?</p>

<p>The whole copyright law should be extremly modified. The copyright law is outdated in the year 2009. In the last 1000 year men could hardly write his name. In the last 50 years, public education raised extremly. In the last 10 years, there was the start for computers for anyone. Today you can write or paint with computers assistance. No song or video is to think about without the help of computers. Thats why men can not claim copyright for itself. So all copyright work on electronic media can not be claimed with copyright. For example a butcher work , a good piece of meat can not be given a copyright neither. Not matter how any newpapers suffer, there is no law that anyone who owns a newspaper, shall be a millionaire.

<p>Journalism is in trouble, but making the copyright laws more restrictive will not solve anything. It will cripple society even more.</p>
<p>The problems with the news business are several, but linking and other fair use are not among them. I'd suggest that the primary issues are:</p>
<p>1. The businesses which own major news organizations are more focused on profitability than ever before, and have thus been cutting quality of reporting. This causes a loss of readership.</p>
<p>2. They have fought the switch from old distribution models to new, and are not adapting to the new models very well. It is not that the web is free vs the printed paper was paid, that is a stupid argument. Consumers paying 50 cents or even $1 for a printed newspaper can't cover much more than the cost of printing and physical distribution, if that.  Many online news sites have too little and poorly placed ads. Yesterday's NY Times was a prime example. The paper version has pages of ads, and ads on every page which also has news content.  The online version has very few ads, and those were not context sensitive.  How about business ads in the business section, technology ads in the tech section, etc.  Its no wonder they aren't making money.</p>
<p>3. The old news business model delivered global/national/regional and local news to a local market, and financed it with local ads.  The new business model needs to expand the ads base, and needs to syndicate what original content it can create much more broadly. Those local ads will not be as lucrative as they once were, because of competition. Get over it, and adapt.</p>
<p>The old school media companies will die if they can't adapt, and that is a byproduct of capitalism.  If society values journalism enough to change basic laws to protect it, then we should value it enough to consider breaking with the capitalistic orthodoxy that holds that everything has a value set by the market.  Rather than protect an entrenched industry's market, perhaps a better solution is to nationalize that industry.  If nationalization is too extreme in one direction, than I'd assert that more restrictive copyright is too extreme in the other.</p>

<div id="c231883">
<p>Dear mr. Posner,</p>
<p>You seem to have triggered quite some discussions on the Internet with this blog post.</p>
<p>Especially with the following quote: "Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, might be necessary to keep free riding on content financed by online newspapers from so impairing the incentive to create costly news-gathering operations that news services like Reuters and the Associated Press would become the only professional, nongovernmental sources of news and opinion."</p>
<p>I think the existing copyright laws are more than sufficient to protect any news organization from unauthorized usage of their works.</p>
<p>First of all, excessive paraphrasis might be just an ordinary copyright infringement. Although, gathering news and facts from several sources and writing your own story around it, is not and should never be. In the end, newspapers don't do anything different for most of their copy. They rely on sources, might it be other papers, on-line content or reporters and journalists.</p>
<p>Secondly, I really don't get how any news organization will ever loose money by having their freely available articles linked. Every organization decides themselves whether or not they provide their information for free on the Internet. If an organization provides it for free, you may expect that they actually WANT you to see this information. Having your articles linked all around the web creates traffic, traffic sells advertisements. Advertisements mean money.</p>
<p>Additionally, the whole World Wide Web would not exist without the notion of the "hyperlink". Without it, I would never have found this blog for example, if you needed to give permission to anybody who wants to link to you. Creating hyperlinks to whatever destination is nothing more than "freedom of speech". I have the right to point to any information I like. Pointing to information is NOT copyright infringement and it never should be. It is you, who clicks on the hyperlink and it is your browser who opens that link.</p>
<p>What strikes me is that Google manages to make a HUGE profit out of on-line advertisement. About 90% of all their profit is a direct or indirect result of on-line advertisements. It seems they do not have a very hard time surviving the economic downturn.</p>
<p>So, why doesn't a news corporation with massive eyeballs like The New York Times not survive on on-line advertisements alone? In the near future, there will be no need for "paper news" and why should there? Are you still taking the horse-drawn cart to your work?</p>
<p>In the near future, ePaper will be a perfect replacement for all those miles of dead trees that are pumped trough those stinking presses every day. Also, people want to interact with the news today. The Internet gives ordinary people a possibility to make their voice heard. News corporations should love this idea, they're getting user-generated content and extra eyeballs for free.</p>
<p>It seems many of those old fashioned news corporations are dying because they are unable to adapt to the changing society. They always had the big money, so they theoretically had the means to adapt and to adapt quickly. If they fail to do so, why should we bother? Eventually, they will be replaced with something new and relevant.</p>
<p>We shouldn't invent new laws to protect companies that fail to adapt. Should we implement new laws because people stopped to buy gas-guzzling cars from GM and the like? For the older generation, that rules our wold, this is sometimes hard to accept. But in the end, in this world there is just one prevailing rule: adapt or die. That's the only way forward.</p>

<p>What Posner does't understand is that a LINK is valuable in cyberspace; in fact, the link is one of the units of currency in the online universe (along with share ratio, etc.). Thus newspapers should embrace blogs that link to their pages: such links direct traffic to the newspapers' websites. Governmental regulation of links would present significant (and most likely insurmountable) First Amendment problems. If a website cannot monetize traffic, that is a problem to be solved with an alternative business model, not with the criminalization of the practice of linking.<br/>

<p>Barring linking to copyrighted content is an ill-thought-through proposition and confirms my long standing discomfort with Judge Posner's increasingly annoying meddling into various and sundry topics and policy areas, much of which amounts to lobbing grenades or the utterance of trite re-hashes.  Boring and unnecessary.</p>

<p>"If this kind of backward idea were to see the light of day, the easy away around it would be to add a Creative Commons waiver, maybe called the "Posner Stupidity Badge" and display it on your website - thus allowing anyone to link to anything on your site."</p>
<p>I agree - Somebody should absolutely create a Posner Stupidity Badge for websites, or better yet, a creative commons logo that reads, "I'm not stupid like Judge Posner."</p>
<p>What a moron. I mean, to all those people who're saying, "...but he's a famous legal mind!" -- it is called fallacy of authority. Just because he's someone big and important does not mean he's not wrong, and it does not mean that he's not stupid (not to mention batshit crazy).</p>

<p>I wouldn't think a form of protectionism would work on this matter. </p>
<p>Newspapers do not need to attempt measures to restrict the flow of their information. It seems to me that they instead have to adapt to the realities just as they did with radio and TV. Obviously speed is the most valuable commodity in the information market and newspapers are increasingly lacking in that department. But speed is not the only valuable asset in a information market. </p>
<p>Newspapers have quality, vetted analysis and information that is still trusted more than tabloid TV talking heads or bloggers. That is just the fact. Newspapers simply have to cater to their strengths in this matter and work on producing the content and they will get readers. </p>
<p>Newspapers also have to adjust to the new market realities. They have more competitors so they must shrink their size and become more efficient. Just as GM was making more cars than they could sell, there are more newspapers than demand calls for. Many local papers should be weeklies. Other than the real big papers like NYT and WSJ there should be no daily paper. </p>
<p>When demand lowers you have to lower supply. If papers lowered their output without lowering their quality and analysis, then they could achieve equilibrium with demand.</p>

<p>In my opinion, these three factors are of utmost importance when approaching this debate:</p>
<p>1. The quality of journalism is integral to a newspaper's success. Better quality, more readers, more readers, more revenue.</p>
<p>2. The amount of marketing the newspaper is undertaking in order to get itself well positioned in an ever-increasing difficult market. The more differentiation strategies adopted, the more chances for success.</p>
<p>3. A physical newspaper has an advantage over online newspapers when it comes to the 'feel' of an actual paper-in-hand experience versus online, many readers still prefer the paper in hand over online.</p>
<p>As you will see, I have not mentioned how a newspaper could decline and how it should be saved. I believe if you focus on how something could be saved from declining, rather than focusing on how it could be made better does nothing but bring on the inevitable disaster. Therefore, newspaper companies should start differentiating themselves with good coverage of events and unbiased journalism, and this will eventually drive them to long-term prosperity.</p>

<p>Online newspapers already have the exclusive right to display their copyrighted work publicly. Your proposal suggests they should get to have their cake and eat it too -- that those who choose to display their work on the Internet should get to sue anyone who takes people to the display. </p>
<p>It would be an afront to fundamental First Amendment principles if I could be prosecuted for transporting someone to a concert -- which is the offline equivalent of linking. The newspapers have, in effect, chosen to offer free open air concerts instead of limiting them to ticket holders. Why on earth should we suggest that because they chose not to charge for admission, the taxi drivers who take people to the free concert should be guilty of copyright infringement because, otherwise, they might go out of business for offering free concerts instead of charging admission?</p>

<p>Judge, newspapers everywhere today are wishing you wouldn't speak for them.  They can stop linking at any moment by closing their sites to the non-paying public.  In fact, EVERY newspaper site has as one of its highest priorities getting search engines and bloggers to link to them.  If copyright laws were changed to forbid linking to copyrighted material - already placed in public view by the copyright owners themselves - it would have two effects:</p>
<p>1) It would doom any hope for the survival of journalism.  Newspapers are dead already.  The public has been walking away from the "print factory" for over 50 years, for God's sake.  This has nothing to do with the internet.  Thank heavens the internet exists, or newspapers would be even less relevant than they are already.  If you care at all, come up with a business model to sustain journalism.  Drop the printers, drop the trucks, drop the ink supplies and paper.  Focus on the one thing newspapers claim to provide of value: journalism.</p>
<p>2) Your proposal would destroy the World Wide Web.  You are aware, one hopes, that by definition, the Web only exists as links.  It is not a library card catalog, providing directions to a shelf on which one may find books.  </p>

<p>So are you going to outlaw footnotes as well? How about "unauthorized" conversations about the news? If I think about the new, do I need a permit? </p>
<p>I don't think I've read such erudite stupidity since I quite being a college professor. This is the sort of crap one expects from a freshman philosophy term-paper. If a newspaper, or anyone else doesn't want links to their content, they don't have to put it online. </p>
<p>You have committed the boneheaded error of confusing the means with the product. Newspapers are as relevant today as quill-pens, but as you point out that has been the case since the advent of radio. Journalism is as important as ever. The truth is that large media conglomerates ceased doing any real journalism ages ago. Why are you trying coddle an industry that is a hundred years out of date? Seems anti-American to me. Why do you hate America?</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I have a newspaper distribution company and have a sincere, vested interest in seeing the newspaper industry's survival.  I struggle with my prejudices and truly wonder how much of my opinion is self-delusion, as in the old adage, "It's difficult to make a man understand something when his livelihood depends on his not understanding it."</p>
<p>Also, as a 32-year-old raised in America who played video games as a child but has, since college, put away childish things and focused on my company, I have difficulty sympathizing with my contemporaries and our successors' points of view on these issues.  </p>
<p>If I follow the argument correctly, the following are truisms to this community:</p>
<p>1) Print is dead, inefficient, in a word, useless, because of its twelve-hour delay to get to the end user</p>
<p>2) Copyright is an outdated concept and if you can't figure out how to monetize your product in a wild-west style environment where anything goes, it's your loss</p>
<p>3) More choice, by definition, is of public benefit and the internet (and computing technology more generally) has lowered barriers to entry to any and all forms of content generation</p>
<p>4) We, the public, are ideally suited to determine for ourselves what we want, when we want it and how much (or little) we want to pay for it.  Because we demand it, as consumers, it must be correct.  If we must 'pay' for this content, fine, try and advertise to us if you can, but don't complain when we create another device that allows us to skip commercials, work around piracy restrictions and otherwise undermine your ability not just to make a profit but to have any predictability whatsoever in your business model</p>
<p>Oviously, I treat with some derision the mentality that supports any and all of the above principles as being unsustainable, unjust and counter to our (and your) long-term interest.</p>
<p>While I respect the talent, initiative and entrepreneurism of everyone who took a risk to start a blog or wrote new software to meet an unfulfilled demand; and those citizens, more generally, who are on the cutting edge of the change in lifestyle, work environment and information distribution the computing age represents, it is clear that respect is not reciprocal.  </p>
<p>Contained in the above posts are, to me, among the most vocal advocates of slash and burn capitalism, an 'adapt or die' mentality that has little respect for stakeholders or citizenry invested in the current model of news generation and distribution.  </p>
<p>The irony is, of course, that most of the above advocates of throwing out newspapers a day earlier than the rest of us would consider themselves defenders of the public interest regarding the environment, the banks, health care and the rest of the litany of topics dominating today's headlines. </p>
<p>Somehow, it is no longer widely understood or accepted that quality journalism has to be performed by professionals who dedicate their lives to its pursuit and that, without them, or editors to pursue the correct story or fact-check or make any other of the myriad editorial decisions we have taken for granted, we are cast adrift in a world where mattpan77 is as valid a news gatherer and social critic as Bob Woodward or Bill Safire.  </p>
<p>I simply reject this idea and cannot be convinced that the public interest is served by tearing down venerable, respected institutions, along with an honorable profession besides, and replacing it with otherwise well-meaning people doing this as a hobby in their spare time.</p>
<p>Even if you disagree with the above paragraph and you webophiles are standing at the ready with a list of a dozen bloggers as examples of those truly patriotic citizens who spend their time reporting and communicating important, incisive information to you, that does not obviate the following point.</p>
<p>Despite the advantages of the internet (which are many) in comparison to old, brick and mortar means of retrieving and gathering information (remember libraries?), to date I do not think the internet has succeeded in increasing access to our most valuable resource:  TIME.  </p>
<p>Since there is no more time in the day, the argument has to be that the internet is a net plus if and only if it saves more time for the average news consumer than it demands.  In my experience, this answer is an unequivocal no, it has not, either in theory or in practice, made us better informed or more engaged citizens in our democracy and, for this, I weep.</p>
<p>In order to make up for the four minutes of average work time a daily New York Times costs and a thirty second walk to the end of the driveway, in return the average citizen has given up much.  Bombarded with even more opportunity to surf, view, blog, Twitter, Facebook and comment (all of which relate to you and yours, or your favorite television show or YouTube video), the average internet user is pampered, made to feel they are on the cutting edge of society and the ones to whom we must subsume all previous ideals of democracy, civics, ethics and definitions of work.  </p>
<p>The 800 pound gorilla is the fact that our culture venerates these millenials as the shrewd, discerning sophisticated creators of our 21st century world when, clearly, a plain, staid appreciation of unchanged pillars of adulthood and participation in our democracy: geography, politics, civics, reasoned thought, accountability, articulate writing and reading comprehension are disappearing faster than the polar ice caps.  This regression predates the internet, certainly, but has only taken on cultural sanction in this decade.  </p>
<p>There is no one answer to excise this cancer and give America a legitimate shot to compete with the rest of the world but, I assure you, to embrace the destruction of journalism, print or otherwise, is not the correct path.  </p>
<p>While I reserve the right to vote against exceptions I find Orwellian or otherwise too stifling, I believe what this country needs is much more a back-to-basics approach than continued destruction of principles that have been integral to western civilization for hundreds of years.  So, I will support a culture, politicians and community leaders who urge restraint in allowing the marketplace to create monopolies, to destroy venerable institutions and to deviate from productive, ethical practices in favor of those that waste more time than they create, distract rather than inform, and paralyze us with choice, in a multicultural corollary that everything is equal, just different.</p>
<p>No.  To paraphrase a Bill Maher quote, facts are indeed more important than feelings; truth is more important than sensitivity, and, to add one of my own, for the millenials, the community is more important than you are.  </p>
<p>Please take stock of your selfish perversions of the American way and steep yourself in the historical record.  This country did just fine before you and your parents came along; have a little respect for the institutions and the people who create content from whom you so readily siphon.</p>
<p>Thank you to those who took the time to read and comment on this.  These disparate and somewhat incongruous thoughts have been bumping into one another for a while in my head and I am happy to have had a forum to express them.  For that, at least, I am grateful to the internet.</p>

<p>"A study last year by the Neiman Foundation found that at least 85% of all the content on "news" websites, blogs, radio and television originated with a print newspaper or its free website. In other words, new media is much more reactive when it comes to news than proactive." </p>
<p>The study needs to "click through" the direct link to the newspaper.  In college, I worked at radio station as a reporter.  In my adult life, I've worked as a part-time reporter.  One of the lessons learned is that a lot of what goes into a newspaper is basically a recycled press release, press conference, public record, or routine update from a public official.  </p>
<p>The Internet is making lots of this information, once available only to reporters, available to everyone.  Press releases can be obtained via rss feed and e-mail lisits.  Press conferences are now often podcast.  Public records can be linked to rather than reviewed where they are created and summarized.  It is only a matter of time before online police blotters are routinely available online, instead of mediated by reporters assigned to that beat.</p>
<p>While newspapers have been and continue to be an important intermediary, a lot of newspaper stories offer little value added.</p>
<p>Also, many online media surveys are guilty of not using weighted averages and not thinking like someone who wants the information.  Blogging has a very long tail with sites that are meaningful but can't be weighted equally with high profile sites.  Even though most blogs are devoted to analysis, pootie pics, and ranting, the minority that do original reporting (or at least, press release, podcast, and public informatioon recycling) are disporportionately important: increasingly sites that offer orginial reporting and instant expert analysis at a time when an issue is hot (Forbes recently turned to the Sentencing Law Prof blog for data on long white collar sentences in connection with the Maddoff case) can become dominant over newspapers.</p>

<p>That's the dumbest thing Posner ever said, and I've read a lot of Posner.  Stick to torts buddy, it's your strong suit.  <br/>
News has been in a golden age for the last 60 years, much like the US.  A Pax Americani, if you will.  That is about to end.  Adapt or die, that is the American way.  The era of a newspaper for every town is gone.  Why buy the Dallas Morning News when the Fort Worth Star-Telegram has the EXACT same content (almost all of the AP wire mind you).<br/>
To say that copyright law, dominated by a select few lawyers, will save the day is just dumb.  Think about the costs Posner!  Litigation in not the answer (lord knows I wish it was, I'd be rich).  The answer is 42, you just need to find the question.</p>

<p>While we're at it we should implement legislation that would protect other defunct, stale, and generally moribund trades?  Telegraph operators took a severe blow from the Telephone.  Radio had a big bite taken out of it by Television.  Knappers were made obsolete by metalworkers.  If print news can not find a way to generate sufficient revenue using their current business methods then they don't deserve to survive.  The demise of non-competitive business models or services that have no perceived value only creates opportunity for others who are willing to take the chance to bring new life into a region currently only occupied by fossils.</p>

<p>I don't think you've considered the unintended consequences or reciprocal effects of your suggestion.</p>
<p>The notion of "illegal paraphrasing" could potentially impose two enormous costs on 'legitimate' news agencies.  First, it could make them targets for frivolous or anticompetitive litigation.  Second, it could impose huge costs in gathering source material.</p>
<p>Like it or not, IP trolling has become a business model.  If two newspapers both cover the same story, one can sue the other for "illegal paraphrasing" and the legitimacy of that claim will have to be worked out between the lawyers, or in court.  Thus you've added 'litigation defense' to the cost of doing business as a news agency, and created a mechanism by which organizations with deep pockets can force smaller competitors out of business, and impose a chilling effect to keep new competition from arising.</p>
<p>If the IP trolls of the news industry follow the best practices of patent trolls and software trolls, the biggest litigants will be aggregators who don't produce any content themselves, but purchase the rights to works written by others.  Thus the New York Times could find itself on the receiving end of a lawsuit from a shell company no one has ever heard of, because the NYT's lead story on some given day happens to cover the same material as something in the troll's arsenal.  The end effect is that those who make money producing actual products for consumers (news that enhances the public good) get edged out by those who have merely found a legal way to carve a chunk out of the public domain.</p>
<p>Of course, the obvious defense against a charge of illegal paraphrasing is to show that one's source material is original.  Unfortunately, those lists of source material are just as problematic as the finished articles.  If a news agency publishes its list of sources, either that list creates a loophole for the free riders ("screw the original article, here are the sources, and my conclusions are strikingly similar to the NYT's") or it's a protected product that IP trolls can exploit ("We will show that the New York Time's list of source material for article X is substantially similar to the published list of source material for story Y, belonging to us.").</p>
<p>Leaving the lists of source materials unpublished would close the loophole for free riders, but only at the expense of making life easier for the IP trolls.</p>
<p>Even more strikingly, you seem to have forgotten that the internet is itself a source for news.  We didn't learn about the Iranian election riots from 'legitimate' news sources.  We learned about them through Twitter.</p>
<p>Copyright applies equally to all works, and exists automatically as soon as the work is created.  My 140-character tweet enjoys exactly the same protection as the NYT's lead story.  Therefore, the NYT would be barred from "illegally paraphrasing" information I've posted to the internet as source material for one of its stories.</p>
<p>Therefore your model creates a system where the only way to establish a truly clear provenance for source material is to have a company staffer on the scene, wherever that scene may be.  That imposes huge staff and/or travel expenses on news agencies, and increases the lead time necessary for them to establish a clear right to publish information about the story.</p>
<p>In the meantime, a thousand everyday citizens on the scene will be texting and tweeting and telling the world what's actually going on, in real time, without the 'benefit' of editing.</p>
<p>And therein lies the real challenge that the internet poses to newspapers:  the internet doesn't just undercut the established publication and distribution mechanism, it's calling the whole value of the editorial process into question.</p>
<p>The editorial process justifies itself by ensuring completeness and accuracy of coverage.  But the editorial process isn't perfect.  It contains intrinsic biases of selection and implication.  Both reporters and editors decide what source material to include in a story, and they choose how to express the information. Dan Rather's coverage of the Bush military memos failed to mention doubts about the authenticity of the documents.  In terms of implication, does a President "attempt to defend" his policy, or did he "answer critics" of that same policy?</p>
<p>Putting all the source material into public view and exposing it to an adversarial process where thousands of people ram their biases against each other offers another way to ensure completeness and accuracy of coverage.  That method isn't perfect either, but it would be hard to prove that the editorial process is better.  Both our legal system and our notion of scientific review work on the same principles.</p>
<p>The internet model is hugely labor-intensive and stinks for releasing a coherent story on a deadline.  On the other hand, it has a pretty good track record of exposing the hurried mistakes and outright fiction regular news agencies have committed.</p>
<p>To pull out a piece of business language, the core competency of traditional news agencies has been its reputation for accuracy and completeness.  Public faith in that reputation has been falling for at least fifteen years, and only continues to slide as more source material comes into the public view, and as traditional news agencies eschew simple reporting of facts for editorials posing as 'news'.</p>
<p>In the language of economists, the marginal cost of giving up news verified by he traditional editorial process in favor of 'whatever seems to be left after the fanatics on all sides have shouted about it for a few days' has fallen.  That devalues traditional news sources.</p>
<p>It doesn't do a damn thing to the-news-as-public-good, though.  All too often these days, the officially validated news stories of important events (like the Iranian election riots) are little more than watered-down versions of what people already saw yesterday on the internet.</p>

<p>"Many great (or OK) writers began as journalists. Print journalism is perhaps the most abundant source of written communcation. As journalism focuses less on long-form articles and more on other forms of communication (videos, tweets, etc.), the effect on writing and literature could be profound."</p>
<p>Yes, it is, but I think that effect will be very, very positive. One of the major reasons that so many great writers began as journalists is because, at the time, writing for a newspaper was one of the very few ways for nascent authors to gain both experience and visibility. The Web has changed all that. Now anyone who wants to write can write, with no need for a publisher and a paycheck. The cream floats to the top, where the possibility of print publishing exists, and the wanna-be's fade away into obscurity. It's the same process, really, as those writers learning their craft and gaining their following in print, except now it's open to everyone. And no, writing for print is not somehow inherently superior. I've learned far more about writing as a blogger than I did as a newspaper columnist (not least because my blog regulars are much more demanding than my editor ever was!). The next generation of great writers won't be found in newsrooms; they're all among us today: they're bloggers, they're amateur fiction writers, they're people with websites full of their poetry, they're all the other people to whom the Web has given a medium and a voice.</p>
<p>The printing press made the hand-copied book obsolete. People mourned the loss of the scribe's personal touch, and decried the "cheapening" of books that were now available to the unwashed masses. Would the world really be better off today if some long-ago Posner had succeeded in banning the printing press to protect the scribes' jobs?</p>
<p>Copyright laws already cover reprinting of news articles; there's no need for a change there, though perhaps some more enforcement. On the other hand, aggregators like Google News drive traffic to the news organizations' websites. Are there people who think a headline and a few dozen words (often less than a full sentence) from a news story are sufficient? Undoubtedly so. But they're not your customers. Someone who is satisfied by "A 2002 will by Michael Jackson, which was filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, could lead to conflict over the singer's assets between Mr." and isn't willing to click through to the newspaper's website to read the full story is CERTAINLY not going to shell out fifty cents to read that story.</p>
<p>Video killed the radio star. Time moves on, technology changes, and society changes with it. There was a past with no printed newspapers; there may very well be a future without them too. Perhaps there will emerge services which evaluate and rate blog posts and other news-like content on behalf of the service's subscribers -- sort of "Rent-an-Editor". More likely there will be something we haven't thought of yet. Twenty years ago, the Web was an idea taking form in Tim Berners-Lee's brain. Today ... well, look at where we're having this discussion. Yes, the future will probably involve fewer jobs at newspapers. How many people today make buggy whips? On the other hand, twenty years ago there were no jobs for website designers.</p>
<p>Change is the only constant.</p>

<p>Over the past 40 years or so, print and TV media have continued to lose credibility.  Once seen as an independent watchdog on the doings and misdoings of government and business, they are now wholly-owned subsidiaries of the corporate establishment and mere parrots for official talking points and handouts.  The declining fortunes of traditional media as well as the trend toward getting news from the Internet are primarily related to the shift in the source of quality information that the public needs.</p>
<p>You can often go right to the sites of primary sources instead of having their knowledge spun and (mis)interpreted by the traditional media who believe that all information must first be boned and filleted for easy digestion and then interpreted for us by said media.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Instead of reading or listening to inadequate, simplistic, sometimes misleading or incorrect, and often self-serving reporting on the economy and the Wall Street bailout, we can directly access the websites and blogs of dozens of the nation's top economists and financial experts (including a number of Nobel Prize winners) read their analyses and opinions, engage in discussions directly with those who have blogs, and then make up our own minds.  </p>
<p>I'm afraid that between the drastic decline in the quality of content of the traditional media and the more direct access to primary sources provided by the Internet, traditional media are inevitably going to go the way of the buggy whip manufacturers.</p>
<p>Another point: the most successful financial model on the Internet so far is revenue from advertising.  As in free, over-the-air TV (a very similar model) and newspapers (whose purchase price is only a small part of their revenue stream), ratings determine the desirability of advertising on a given site as well as the rate the site can command.  The more people watch, the higher the revenues.</p>
<p>By preventing linking to sites like, for example, major newspapers' with on-line news, the major result will be loss of advertising revenue for them - since the number of "hits" on a site is the primary way of measuring its ratings and the links from blogs and other sites bring in a significant number of readers.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to save the traditional media, which advancing technology is dooming to obsolescence along with broadsheets and town criers.  Trying to hobble the Internet will be like the aforementioned buggy whip makers lobbying for laws restricting cars, trains, and airplanes.</p>

<p>1)  Most of us get to a news-site from a blog link. Remove these links, and their visitorship will shrink even more.  And I suppose you own Google stock?</p>
<p>2)  Print and broadcast media are dying because they LIE.  As a teacher, I gave a weekly assignment to find a newspaper article with blatant lies. They never had any difficulty finding something.   In fact, half the time the very first sentence contradicted the headline.</p>
<p>3)  Newspaper content costs almost nothing.  All they do is cut and paste from the wire duopoly, and PR releases.  There are no more reporters is the corporate media.</p>

<p>So your proposing reversal of the incredible expansion in availability of information that the internet has allowed. In essence you want to put the genie back in the bottle. By preventing this you would be handing the newspapers not only a monopoly over news itself but also a monopoly over the analysis of that information, in effect censoring any views that the newspaper "dictatorships" did not agree with. I am horrified that such a proposal is being put forward by "legal experts" outside a totalitarian regime.</p>
<p>The real problem is that the traditional business of newspapers is dying, indeed it may already be dead. The traditional newspaper companies have simply not found a way to make money in the new world, that is their fault for clinging to the old medium well beyond it's usefulness. They, or someone else, will figure out how to package it and make money at it. Passing laws to curtail the spread of information is placing the "blame" for newspapers demise on the consumer instead of where it rightly belongs, on the owners and boards of the newspapers. They failed to foresee that the internet has irrevocably changed the business they are in.</p>
<p>The fact is people no longer wish to pay for collections of random articles handpicked by newspaper editors. Consumers will, and I do, pay for subscriptions to online information and analysis tailored to ones particular interests. The sites I pay for I found because they were "paraphrased and linked" by other sites. That's free marketing in my book, I would have never found these sites and without this freedom many useful sites would never be able to reach their target audience.</p>

what is really boils down to is that you can not control it anymore. You people who think you are better than everyone can not feed your stories to us like you used to. Long ago, Hearst went to Deadwood Territory and opened up a newpaper then printed things that would benefit himself. Same thing now 120+ years later.

<p>A particular man who adamantly refused to sell his claim was murdered. The suspect was a Hearst employee, but he was acquitted when the court could not get any witnesses to testify. Hearst bought a newspaper in Deadwood to help sway the public opinion of him, and a competing newspaperâs editor was beaten up in the street. The tension prompted Hearst to write to his partners asking http://www.deadwoodmagazine.com/article.php?read_id=176<br/>

<p>Judge, it is difficult for me not to just call you a complete and utter idiot and leave it at that but I will try to be respectful and we can both "agree to disagree" but we should both agree that you are DEAD WRONG! "Fair Use" has no place in the contemporary world  of Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and other ignorant tools of New World Order journalism. If you and your "mainstream friends" were not so insistent on being de facto "State-run media," people wouldn't be so eager to jump ship to the alternative. <br/>
<br/>
You either are simply ignorant and have been inculcated by the biased and flawed system you are trying to protect or you actually have nefarious intentions of continuing and protecting the censorship of REAL AND ACCURATE NEWS. Your beloved old newspapers (and other mainstream media empires) are dying because they simply cannot help themselves. Mainstream media is far more concerned with shaping public opinion and promulgating propaganda than they are with reporting truthful, accurate news! The segment of the citizenry who are the buyers of newspapers and the consumers of journalism can only take so much despicable, manifest LYING before they feel compelled to seek more reliable, alternative sources. I don't need the NYT or Hurst to shape my opinions for me. Perhaps we should not stop with "outlawing" hyperlinks? Maybe we should condemn all "non-conforming" thought as well? <br/>
<br/>
I will agree that part of newspapers' problems lie with Generation "D" being largely apathetic, stupid, and too lazy to demand that mainstream media maintain a level of integrity. It is, unfortunately, true that this lobotomized generation is content to get what little knowledge of current events they have from The Daily Show or Cobert. Additionally, government controlled indoctrination centers and liberal, leftist academics in higher education are partially to blame as well.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, your many assumptions regarding the economy are just plain ignorant! The economy IS NOT going to get any better! The state of our economy and standard of living is a matter of perception. Through incrementalism, the sheep will begin to accept a new lower quality-of-life and when that acceptance takes hold, the perception of "recession" will be over. I am continuously amazed by the foolish naivety of people like you who, for example, refer to a "non-recessionary year." You indoctrinated bobble-heads still think that manipulated calculations by your globalist government indicating that we have not had "two successive quarters of negative growth" are REAL benchmarks in assessing the state of the economy. The country's "recession" is at least 20 years old and now we are in a DEPRESSION! When will you pathetic fools accept the premise that "free trade" and immigration with second and third world countries ALWAYS results in economic, social, cultural, and ecological parity with those same countries? That is a far more accurate measure of the quality-of-life factor than are some silly, stupid, manipulated numbers regarding so-called growth of globalist corporations and criminal government bureaucrats. There is not one iota of economic improvement anywhere on the horizon. Your country and entire way of life are things of the past. And that is exactly what you despicable sons-of-bitches wanted so I hope you "enjoy" it!</p>

<p>Here's an idea. Maybe newspapers should got back to actually reporting the news and the truth, instead of being propaganda outlets for the government and big corporations. I think people would be more willing to support newspapers if they weren't lying all the time.</p>
<p>I would certainly not support the banning of hyperlinks (are you nuts?) to save these worthless beat rags.</p>

<p>Linking drives readers TO the news sites and likewise their advertisers; </p>
<p>AP/Reuters association results in multitudes of duplicated articles so frequently that fresh content is going by the wayside; </p>
<p>Most websites online are fully aware of fair use and copyright protections and set a maximum number of paragraphs for the linked article that are permitted for quotation purposes, provided that links MUST BE USED for the quoted material in order that credit is properly given and research is possible.</p>

<p>The newspaper industry is a victim of disruptive technology that has been hiding in plain sight for years.</p>
<p>Historically, there were two barriers to entry into the news business:  content creation (which required reporters on the ground kicking up stories) and distribution channels (which required capital intensive infrastructures like printing presses, delivery trucks, etc.)  The second barrier has been absolutely shattered by the Internet.  The first barrier, while not completely shattered, has been significantly lowered by the "crowd sourcing" effects of the Internet.  There are now millions of sources that a new media journalist can draw upon without ever leaving her keyboard.</p>
<p>This disruption is inevitable.  Copyright regulations will not save the printing presses and trucks.</p>

<p>Sorry to say but you really haven't thought that linking idea through. Linking is not copying, and that seems to be the cause of an inordinate amount of confusion in your argument. Linking provides a way to *avoid* copying other people's contents or paraphrasing it, and this is done by pointing the reader in the direction of the original story.</p>
<p>Forbidding linking would be as fundamentally nonsensical as saying that because people pay to have houses built for themselves, it should be forbidden to make any sort of map.</p>
<p>You'll just have to accept that you don't know what you're talking about when it comes to the internet and how it works. </p>

<p>Posner,</p>
<p>I think you need to learn a little more about the way internet traffic works. Unfortunately, you seem to think that getting a link is a BAD thing.</p>
<p>The exact opposite is true. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank See, pages that have more links have higher ranks, show up higher on searches, and thereby get more traffic. On the WWW, more traffic with translate into more money, whether through advertising or other services the website provides.</p>
<p>So banning linking will only HARM, definitely not benefit the newspaper industry.</p>

<p>45 years ago the newspaper was a bright spot in our house every evening.  The sections were doled out, Sports to my brother, front page to my grandfather, ads and human interest to my grandmother and I got the comic section.  It was a time of family settling down to read and listen to my grandmother comment about who died, who had a baby, and who was dismissed from the hospital.  The newspaper was the only communication we had for local and state news.  <br/>
 I have no interest in a newspaper these days.  It's full of yesterday's news that I heard about the minute it happened across the world the day before.  Newspapers may have a place in my heart but no place in my home. Cynthia B.   </p>

<p>Let's look at Posner's musings for what they are--pure nostalgia for a time gone by, reminiscences about the past with fear, uncertainty and doubt about the future--e.g., pure FUD.</p>
<p>With what simplicity and elegance does the Constitution of the United States lend itself to the establishment of copyright law?</p>
<p>"To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."</p>
<p>Promote progress? Limited times? Today's copyright terms are now granted in excess of 100 years--life plus 70 years to be specific. In what way can that be considered "limited" when it exceeds the modern lifespan of virtually any human being? How exactly do such unlimited terms "promote" progress?</p>
<p>So, in light of such UN-limited copyright, shall we also continue to further erode the concept of Fair Use in copyright simply to save an antiquated business model dying from its own lack of inventiveness and design? Shall we further demote progress?</p>
<p>Certainly, the modern newspaper suffers most because of its lack of desirable content, either online or off, and significantly less because of the parasitic effects of blogs and other online media outlets. "All the news that's fit to print?" Hardly, as I certainly cannot find most of the truly important news of the world printed in the New York Times at all, or any other print newspaper, including online editions of those notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Most modern news outlets are incapable of serving the interests of the modern reader, while the myriad of online sources are. How many times have we heard of the main stream media, over and over again, collecting their news from online sources that have "scooped" them first.</p>
<p>I would suggest to the estimable Judge Posner that the problem is not with "linking," but with a majority of entirely undesired content from most of the MSM. Legislation and lawsuits are the last refuge of the dead and dying. Expanding already overly broad copyright law would serve no purpose other than to further limit freedom of speech and expression. </p>
<p>Let the dinosaurs die. That's what they're supposed to do.</p>

<p>In economics there's a concept called "creative destruction". We're no longer using horse drawn coaches to travel. We're using cars, buses, trains, etc. This was a devastating shift to the horse drawn coach industry but it allowed us to move on to something better.</p>
<p>Let me say it clearly for the people still grasping onto the past. Traditional media is DEAD. Printed newspapers are dead, CDs/DVDs and other traditional forms of selling entertainment are dead. Instead of protecting old ways of life by creating idiotic organizations like the RIAA/MPAA or banning links we need to move on and let these industries go to the grave where they belong.</p>

<p>How many gas and kerosene lamps do you use in your home? Electric lighting was brighter, safer, easier.</p>
<p>Got a stable behind the house and a matched pair of horses to pull your carriage?</p>
<p>What you are proposing is the same thing. The world is always changing. Technology has reached the news business. How we manage that is being worked out in the free market. Newspaper businesses need to find a new business model that doesn't involved cutting down trees, making thousands of tons of paper, transporting that paper, printing newspapers, then transporting the printed papers filled with yesterday's news to homes, stores and vending machines every day. What is the "green savings" of banning printed newspapers? </p>
<p>Linking allows me to cite a source, then post my own thoughts, just like you. I am using the copyrighted material any differently than I would with a cited source in an annotated report. </p>
<p>On line news provides more up to date content. In 1985, reading the Sunday New York Times in semi-rural North Carolina meant driving into town on a Wednesday to the only bookstore. They got the paper delivered from the previous Sunday and it cost $5.00. Now it means logging in and clicking the link, and it is the current paper.</p>
<p>In fact, your page asked for my URL as I was posting my comment. I provided it, and you are now linked to my copyrighted content. That's what the internet is. A web of links.</p>
<p>When you come to understand the technology you are using, you will be better able to comment. If newspapers want to charge for their on line content, it is their right to do so. I can then choose to pay or not. In a similar way, I can choose to buy today's New York Times, or go to the public library and read the one they have on the shelf. Is it stealing if I read the library copy? Is it copyright infringement if I point out and discuss an article with another patron?</p>

<p>This, I'm afraid, is the over riding public sentiment: if something is on the internet, it is free for the taking.  The ONLY way to solve these problems is by educating the internet using public, and making copyright infringement a criminal rather than civil matter. A few convictions for using copyrighted material will, no doubt, inprove returns on investment on internet based journalism.</p>

<p>All I can say is that your editorial here is a well thought out piece of bunk.</p>
<p>Newspapers are failing because they aren't delivering much of what people want.  Reporting rarely happens anymore and has devolved into pure "copy and paste" from press releases and press kit statements.  Rarely does a news reporter report anything they've "investigated" in the traditional sense.  </p>
<p>The extreme proliferation of national media and large media conglomerates buying up local stations, newspapers, and so forth have also contributed to this problem.  As someone said earlier, there's no more local news in most newspapers anymore.  It's all from "over there" instead.</p>
<p>Where I live, in Wyoming, the two largest state-wide newspapers tend to front page local news much more often than national stories.  Why?  They realize that if we want national news, we'll read the readily-available USA Today or NYT, or whatever else is on the stand.  So they keep their subscribers and readers.</p>
<p>The next and most obvious is the fact that the news we as Americans receive about national and international events is heavily filtered.  We could point to all kinds of "Big Media 5" or other conspiracies to explain this, but the fact remains: what I read in national newspapers here is nothing like what I read in most Middle Eastern, European, or Russian press.  </p>
<p>The print media in America has to realize that they're failing because of their own failures.  They failed to grasp new technology, to consistently deliver quality, and to hold their place as the fourth check under the First Amendment.  </p>
<p>In other words, print media needs to wake up and realize that finger pointing can't be made without first looking in the mirror.  Most of their problems are their own creation.  </p>
<p>I don't think that 2 of the Big 3 in Detroit were worth bailing out and neither do I think the printed news is worth it either.  </p>
<p>Let the vast majority of today's so-called journalists find another line of work.  I don't see the good ones, like John Stossel or William Grigg begging for work or decrying their industry's decline.</p>

<p>In suggesting that quotes, paraphrasing, and linking -back be restricted, you show just how unfamiliar you are with online media, and traffic.</p>
<p>Quoting (or paraphrasing) and linking back are pure gold to the original publisher. First, it drives traffic (readers) to the original site. Secondly, it provides search engine weight to the original article, causing it to rise higher in the SEO rankings when contextual search terms are applied.<br/>
Third, the more traffic a site has and the higher it appears in related search engine queries, the more a publisher can charge for advertising.</p>
<p>By imposing more nonsensical regulation as you suggest, you would be:<br/>
1. Drastically decreasing traffic to the originating website<br/>
2. Harming the originating website's SEO rankings<br/>
3. Decreasing the amount of revenue the originating site can bring in based on daily traffic and SEO rankings.</p>
<p>As usual, more regulations = kill the market.</p>
<p>Instead of demanding regulations meant to halt or slow the demise of the print news and in the process hamper *all* of the other website owners online, why not demand that the print news innovate and adapt?  </p>
<p>Regulations do not spur innovation and creativity, free markets do.</p>

<p>This quote is scary:<br/>
""Expanding copyright law to bar online access to copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, or to bar linking to or paraphrasing copyrighted materials without the copyright holder's consent, might be necessary to keep free riding on content financed by online newspapers from so impairing the incentive to create costly news-gathering operations that news services like Reuters and the Associated Press would become the only professional, nongovernmental sources of news and opinion.""</p>
<p>If a linked page's author must be contacted before linking, the Internet would fall apart. That is just not how it works. If there is a static URI for a piece of content, anybody can access that content from that URI. It is natural that people share that, as if they were sharing the street address of a business. You cannot assume that linking should be disallowed by default. </p>
<p>And paraphrasing? If we must modify the law so that people can't paraphrase one another without permission, we can have no conversations at all. Mr. Posner said that we might need to limit the public's right to quote and paraphrase in order to save a newspaper.... oh, wait I can't say that? You suggest that I shouldn't be able republish your little quote at the top of this comment to let you know what I'm talking about? C'mon. "Quotes" and paraphrases are seen in every academic book, without the permission of the quoted author. This is how we talk and write. It is how conversation happens. The news is meant to be talked about, linked to, discussed, and critiqued. It really is no different on the Internet, but some people think that newspaper writers should be unquotable. Why should a critical right of the public (to discuss the news of the day) be cannibalized to "save" the profitability of dead-tree printers? </p>
<p>Your little suggestion is not so little.. The right to quote and paraphrase is essential and reaches into every facet of our lives... quoting and paraphrasing news articles on one's blog or "aggregator" cannot be distinguished in my mind from the same activity in any other context. Talking about stuff, and providing necessary context and reference to my audience is a natural part of effective communication. ("Richard Posner, on his blog at http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2009/06/the_future_of_n.html said..." -- Recognize this format as the normal way to write in the 21st century.)</p>

<p>No law is at all required for newspapers to make their sites unable to be linked to. Any newspaper can easily modify their site to either require login (after which they can redirect you anywhere) or to make links temporary so links only work from your computer and for a short period of time.</p>
<p>When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail; when you're a judge, everything looks like "there ought to be a law".</p>
<p>No newspaper in their right mind would do this because it would make their site traffic drop dramatically, since the site would be unusable and not indexed on search engines. However, it is simple to do with existing technology and there's no need to apply law here.</p>

<p>Wow.  Lunacy.  As others have explained so clearly and accurately, using facts from so many fields (economics, law, psychology), this post is just wrong.</p>
<p>It's frighteningly wrong.  I thought you had some understanding of the "copyright bargain".  Apparently not.</p>
<p>Recall that the US Justice System is considered less and less Just and more and more of a joke every year -- because it is criminalizing activities which are normal and desirable, for the theoretical (but not actual) benefit of certain entrenched groups.  Copyright law is a prime example, with absolutely ludicrous terms which the Founders would have thought they'd prohibited, and ever-less-sane arguments being made all the time -- this one tops the list, though.  But drug laws are equally disastrous.  And in industry, judge-made patent law is widely recognized as an unmitigated disaster which is causing major economic damage.</p>
<p>This is not good for the justice system.  The justice system needs people's trust in order to function, and when it criminalizes something which a *supermajority* of people consider right -- as with noncommercial file sharing -- it loses people's trust.  Judges are in danger of being considered arcane and distant tyrants, not supporters of justice.  Insane suggestions like yours would make things much worse.</p>
<p>Of course, the main expense of newspapers is not journalists, it's printing and distribution.  We already *have* a small number of online-only investigative journalists (Marcy Wheeler, for instance), so it's evident there will be more.  Furthermore, quality sells -- the Financial Times is even more successfully profitable than the WSJ, last I checked; the Guardian has been claiming audience in the US.  The distribution of news will change, but it will be just fine.  I read talkingpointsmemo.com, guardian.co.uk, and ft.com -- none in any financial danger -- and get a perfectly solid supply of news, much better than I got from TV or US newspapers.</p>
<p>The state of the law is more dire and more worrisome.  A restoration of the core terms of the 1976, or better, the 1909 Copyright Act, could save copyright law from the damnation of contradicting people's mores and common sense  But perhaps this will have to wait until a younger generation of judges, who grew up with computers and the Internet, are in office, and can finally recognize the outrageous copyright powergrabs made in recent years for what they are..</p>

<p>The whole point of the web is to have a vast repository of *interlinked* information.  Without links the web isn't the web.  If you don't want people linking to your stuff then don't put it on the web!  It is not the job of our courts to prop up a failing business model.  As for me, I ended my subscription to my local paper years ago, not because of the internet, but because I got tired of their unrelenting advocacy of illegal immigration, affirmative action, and every government boondoggle that the liberals can think of.  I'll be happy to see them go bust.</p>

<p>Banning the linking to other online sources must be the most moronic idea I've heard in a very long time. As I've been saying, the human race is becoming more and more stupid, and this proposed ban is yet another example that proves my point.</p>

<p>Ridiculous. Some unconnected observations:</p>
<p>Traditional media was happily beating the war drums during 2003 and failed in their role as the 4th power.</p>
<p>Most major newspapers are filled with mediocre celebrity gossip and other mundane articles in the hope of attracting readers. Factually correct and socially relevant journalism is a rarity nowadays.</p>
<p>The web is the web. If you don't want to be linked to by other sites, don't publish the content online for free! Demand money from visitors. Implement subscription services.</p>
<p>Why should we have invasive changes to one of the most important medium of our time just because of a certain interest group that doesn't know how to handle the challenges of the digital age? Why should we suffer from it? The web existed before you have embraced it, it does not belong to you.</p>
<p>By the way, I wonder why The Economist continues to do well?</p>

<p>Most third-party news sites offer commentary on news stories and links to sources, or links to sources in an easy to read/scan/search format. The law specifically allows for these activities, so it wouldn't be expanding as much as a wholesale change in the spirit and letter of the law. These sites, if anything, drive traffic to the sites, and if  a particular site copy/pastes news from a source and is not providing these services, then it is already infringement. <br/>
Basically, if you plan on stopping those sites from distributing the news that way, you should be prepared to say goodbye to NPR reports as well.</p>

<p>@annonymous (7/17/09 3:23) is correct - breaking the links pointing to newspaper sites would destroy the offpage SEO advantages they gain from backlinks. IMHO, the backlinks from coverage is worth more than whatever newspapers would gain in housing the "initial" visit on their site anyway.</p>

<p>Posner has it backwards: linking should be required.  The primary revenue souce, as with TV and newspapers now, will be advertising, with subscriptions being a minor source for newspapers and zero for TV.</p>
<p>What is needed is required linking, so that the original sources of information are rewarded by users traveling back down the links.</p>
