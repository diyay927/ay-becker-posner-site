<p class="MsoNormal">President Obama during this past week signed into law
extending unemployment benefits to a maximum of 99 weeks, or almost two years,
for persons who have been unemployed for over half a year and have exhausted
their state benefits. The degree of extension varies among states
depending on a state’s unemployment rate, with higher unemployment states
getting longer durations of coverage. The bill that became law is highly
partisan, passing with almost all Democrats, 31 House Republicans, and only 2
Republican senator<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><a class="msocomanchor" href="#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" language="JavaScript" name="_msoanchor_1" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_1')" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_1','_com_1')"></a><span></span></span></span>s.
<span> </span>I believe the law extends
unemployment benefits for too long, although the economics of optimal
unemployment insurance gives a less than certain answer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unemployment insurance tries to balance two conflicting
goals. One is to protect at least some of the earnings of workers laid off from
their jobs through no fault of their own, while the conflicting goal is not to
make unemployment status so comfortable that workers try to get laid off, and
do not look seriously for jobs when they are unemployed. The first aim is a
typical goal of insurance against bad outcomes, while the second goal is to
reduce the degree of “moral hazard”; that is, to reduce the incentive of
persons to reduce their efforts to remain employed and look seriously for work
when unemployed because they have insurance against the cost of being unemployed. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One typical way insurance tries to reach a compromise
between these conflicting goals is to have a deductible that is paid by insured
persons, such as the $500 deductible many car owners have on their
automobile insurance. The trouble with practically all the state-run
unemployment insurance plans is that they typically have no or a minimal
deductible because they provide coverage essentially from the first week of
unemployment. In addition, they usually limit coverage to a fixed number of
weeks, such as 26 weeks. This is an inefficient and costly approach since
practically all the unemployed can readily cover their first several weeks of
unemployment from savings, spouses’ earnings, or borrowing on credit cards and
in other ways. Unemployed workers usually run into financial trouble only when
they have been unemployed for an extended time. An optimal unemployment
insurance plan would make unemployed workers responsible for their first month
or two of unemployment, and mainly spend unemployment insurance resources on
the longer-term unemployed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A second insurance approach to the moral hazard problem is
to require significant co-payments, so that the insured have to pay a portion
of any additional losses they experience after they exhaust the deductible.
American unemployment insurance plans usually do pretty well on this by only
paying about half or so of the earnings the unemployed had received when they
were employed. Many European plans had usually replaced most or all of the
earnings of the unemployed, and covered unemployed for many years. After they
learned the hard way the prediction of economic theory that this encouraged
significant increases in unemployment, several countries greatly cut back both
the duration and payment (i.e., replacement) rates for the unemployed.
Interestingly, In Germany this was done under a center-left Social Democratic
government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This analysis of insurance provides background for
evaluating the new extension of unemployment benefits for the longer-term
unemployed. The approximately $30 billion committed to this extension has been
partly justified as a stimulus to what may be a slowing US economy. However,
since any “stimulus” from $30 billion would be paltry even to the most
optimistic stimulus calculations, such a stimulus can hardly be a serious
justification for this extension of benefits. This is especially the case when
federal budget deficits have been so large during the past couple of years, and
there is no serious evidence that the $800 billion stimulus package
passed over a year ago has had much stimulating effect on unemployment or GDP.
Much of the evidence usually cited about number of jobs created by the stimulus
package is based on terrible analysis. Any new hires under stimulus money is
assumed to be net jobs created by the stimulus rather than a transfer of
employment from non-stimulus activities to stimulus-supported activities.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So the case for the new law rests on its insurance
provisions rather than on its stimulus capabilities. I argued earlier that
covering the longer-term unemployed is the more optimal way to approach
unemployment insurance since the long-term unemployed face the largest economic
hardship. From that viewpoint, extending the duration of coverage beyond 6
months makes sense in an environment where the unemployment rate
remains excessively high at 9.5%, especially if the extension is accompanied by the
elimination of unemployment coverage for the first 6-8 weeks of unemployment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, the actual large extension poses a major risk of
creating an unemployment culture where men and women remain “ unemployed” for
years. Once the period of unemployment becomes long enough, people begin to get
the habits from being unemployed for a long time: they sleep late, develop
various leisure interests, and at the same time their work skills depreciate
from not using them for an extended period. Studies have shown that skill
depreciation is a serious effect of being unemployed for a long time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Some might retort that this argument is persuasive during
periods of normal unemployment rates, perhaps 7% and under, but not when jobs are scarce, the
unemployment rate is over 9%, and it is coming down slowly. There is merit to this
response, but on the other hand, the JOLTS data show that even with the current
high unemployment rates, about 4.5 4 million persons were hired in May 2010
(and about the same number are either being laid off or quitting their jobs).
So for the most part, even the long term unemployed can find jobs if they are
willing to take a cut in their earnings, and/or move to other industries and
occupations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This analysis leads me to the following conclusions. During
bad times, 6 months of unemployment compensation may not be long enough, but
the 2 years in the new law is too long.<span>  </span>About 9 months of unemployment compensation
would be the right length. Anyone unemployed longer than that would lose these benefits. If they want to work
they should be forced to adjust, at least temporarily, to the bad economic
environment, and accept jobs that they would turn down during good economic
times.</p>
