<p class="MsoNormal">The entitlement fiscal burden from projected spending increases on
retirement benefits and health care during the next couple of decades is scary
for Western Europe, Japan, The United States, and other rich nations. I will
concentrate on the US, but the picture is often as bad or worse in these other
nations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In 2010, spending on social security retirement benefits
amounted to about 4.3% of American GDP, while Medicare and Medicaid added
another 5 ½ %. This gives a total federal spending on health and retirement
benefits of about 10% of GDP, which is 40% of overall federal government
spending of 25% of GDP. Without incorporating the effects on spending of the
new health care bill, and with no further changes in retirement ages and other
aspects of social security benefits, the combined spending on these
entitlements is expected to rise in twenty years to about 15% of projected GDP.
The expected increase in spending on health of the elderly is the biggest
component of this increase, although social security payments will also rise
significantly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">State and city obligations to retirees are often forgotten
in calculating the burden of government commitments to retirement and health
benefits, but these too are sizable for many localities. A recent report in the
New York Times indicated that a new analysis of California’s pension liabilities found a
hidden shortfall of more than half a trillion dollars. This is several times as
large as the state pension obligations that had been reported, and over six
times the size of California’s outstanding bonds. Calculations for Illinois and
some other states, and also for some cities, also indicate large future pension
obligations. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That the retirement obligations of state and local
governments are sizable is not surprising since they have early retirement ages
for police, firemen, and other government employees. These governments also usually use
earnings in the last year or two prior to retirement to determine the level of
retirement benefits. Hence government employees nearing retirement have strong
incentives to push for higher pay and overtime work since higher earnings then
have a multiplier effect on the size of retirement benefits.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Future fiscal problems for the federal government will be particularly
challenging not only because entitlements are growing rapidly, but also because
the federal debt has been ballooning due to the extraordinary deficits during
the past two years. Large deficits are likely also for the next couple of
years. The combined cost of interest on government debt, social security
benefits, and spending under Medicare and Medicaid will take at least 20% of
projected GDP by 2030, even without any sizable increase in the interest rates
that creditors demand to hold the much larger US government debt. This percent equals
about 80% of current government spending relative to GDP, and is a full 100% of
the ratio of federal government to GDP for several decades prior to the
financial crisis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several reforms could greatly slow the growth in federal,
state, and local retirement benefits. The most basic would be to change social
security and other retirement systems to defined contribution individual account
systems. By that I mean that state and local government employees, and everyone
under social security, would accumulate tax free retirement accounts from
annual contributions to these accounts, perhaps forced contributions from their
annual earnings. Such accounts would be similar to the IRA and Roth accounts
that many people already have, although rules might control the allocation of
funds in these accounts among stocks, bonds, and cash. This control on asset
allocation would be designed to prevent the elderly from taking excessive
risks, and then needing to be bailed out by government transfers.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If such a fundamental reform is not politically feasible,
then minimum retirement ages to collect social security benefits should be raised to age 70 for the
general population in recognition of the actual and projected growing health of
older persons. Exceptions would be made for the truly disabled, and for workers
in physically demanding jobs, such as firemen and policemen. However, even in
these occupations the large majority of employees are capable of continuing to
work beyond the young current retirement ages. Indeed, many policemen retire in
their fifties with generous pensions to take jobs with private security firms. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Reforming Medicare is even more difficult politically, as
seen from the content of the recently passed health care legislation. Among
other approaches that could save sizable amounts of public spending on health
care (several possible reforms are discussed in our posts of last week on the
new health care legislation), the out-of-pocket spending required of the
elderly covered under Medicare could be greatly raised from its present quite
low level. It could be increased by raising sharply both deductible levels required
of most Medicare recipients and their co-pay rates. As a result of the low
out-of-pocket expenses under the present system, neither patients nor their
physicians have strong incentives to make serious benefit-cost calculations of whether
expensive treatments are desirable. Another useful reform would be to extend
the minimum age of Medicare coverage to age 70, whereas during recent Congressional
discussions of health care bills, opponents had to beat back efforts to lower
rather than raise the minimum age at which a person becomes eligible for
Medicare.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The burden of entitlements and other government spending
depends very much on the growth of GDP since it is the ratio of government
spending to GDP that determine the real tax burden. If GDP could grow by ½
percent per year faster than it would otherwise, the effects on GDP and the tax
burden of given government spending in twenty and thirty years would be enormous. To achieve such a higher
growth rate would require lower, not higher, taxes on both physical and human
capital, more, not less, encouragement to entrepreneurial activities, and
greater emphasis on competition in labor and product markets instead of
bailouts of companies like GM, Chrysler, and Citibank that were badly managed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All of my suggestions would be met by strong political
opposition from entrenched interest groups, such as the elderly, government
unions, and poorly managed companies. Yet without these changes, or something
comparable, the entitlement and debt burden at all levels of government will
grow during the next couple of decades to levels that will become a serious
drag on the performance of the American economy. And as I indicated at the beginning,
similar, if not larger, problems are confronting Western Europe and Japan.</p>
