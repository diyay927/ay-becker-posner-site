<p class="MsoNormal">After falling rather sharply in 2008 and early 2009,
American GDP grew at a good pace in the fourth quarter of 2009, but has slowed
down during the second quarter of 2010. Unemployment declined to 9.5% from its
peak in November 2009 of 10.2%, but has been stuck around its current level for
several months.<span>  </span>This has led to
growing fears of a double dip recession, and to a call for still greater fiscal
stimulus. I do not believe that either of these is correct, and that the
federal government should be concentrating on providing a good economic
environment to encourage businesses and entrepreneurs to invest, hire, improve
productivity, and raise longer-term economic growth of the US. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">More than 60 years ago, Arthur Burns- former head of the
NBER and Chairman of the Fed- and Wesley Mitchell-founder of the NBER- together
wrote a classic study of business cycles called “Measuring Business Cycles”.
They divided business cycles into several stages, such as the economic peak, economic
decline, trough, early recovery, late recovery, and then a peak again. They
clearly show that business cycles are of uneven length, depth, and severity,
and that recoveries do not always proceed smoothly. A recession ends after the
trough is passed, but they recognized that during recoveries an economy takes a
while before it reaches and then surpasses its earlier peak. So from this
perspective, the troubles the American economy is experiencing are not
unprecedented, or even unusual.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, I agree with Posner that something is rotten
about this recovery from the so-called great recession. The Federal Reserve was
slow to react to the financial crisis, but on the whole the Fed’s policies
since then have been decent, given the many unknowns as it tried various old
and new monetary approaches to stem the financial crisis. The financial picture
was quite bleak as banks greatly increased their ratio of debt to assets during
the boom years, and consumers rapidly expanded their debt to income ratios
during these years. So even with the best of responses the recovery probably
would have been slow and uneven.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But both the Congress and the administration of President
George W. Bush, and especially the Congress and President Obama since his
election in 2008 made the main mistakes after the crisis hit. Instead of
concentrating mainly on fighting the recession and promoting faster economic
growth, the Congress elected in 2008 believed they had a mandate to radically
remake the American economy. Aside from repeated attacks on American business,
especially banks-some of them deserved- they not only passed various stimulus
packages (that did not stimulate much), but also tried to promote a vast
legislative program that had nothing to do with fighting the recession. This
program was aimed at reengineering the American economy. It included radical
changes in the health care system, proposed taxes on carbon emissions by
companies, much larger subsidies to alternative sources of energy, such as wind power,
proposals to raise taxes on higher income individuals and on corporate profits,
and to raise the taxes on capital gains and corporate dividends. It also
includes a movement to make anti-trust laws less pro-consumer and more
protective of competitors from aggressive and innovative companies. It has as
its centerpiece a financial reform bill that was a complicated and a
politically driven mixture of sensible reforms, and senseless changes that had
little to do with stabilizing the financial architecture, or correcting what
was defective in prior regulations.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In previous posts I have laid out some of the major defects
in the financial reform act, the healthcare changes, and the unemployment
extension bill (see my posts for 7/25 on unemployment, 7/11 on financial
reform, and 3/28 on healthcare reforms). To single out a few points of these
arguments, I criticized the financial reform bill for, among other things,
neglecting to do anything about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two major
corporations that were important factors in causing the financial debacle, and
for adding an excessive amount of discretion to financial regulators who did
not use wisely the discretion they had prior to the crisis. I suggested that a
proper unemployment bill would eliminate most unemployment benefits for persons
during the first couple of months of their unemployment, and then use the savings
from that to extend unemployment benefits during bad times to a year. The most
desirable reform of health care should have been to increase the out of pocket
share of medical expenses borne by older persons and other individuals with
various illnesses- as in countries like Switzerland- but nothing much was done
about this in the new law. My detailed criticisms are available in these posts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps the new Congress elected after November will try to
reverse some of these mistakes. I would like also to see a radical reform of
the tax system that returns it to the income tax structure that resulted from
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 promoted by President Reagan, and Democrats Senator
Bill Bradley and Representative Richard Gephardt. This Act had a maximum personal
income tax rate of 28%, except for a “bubble rate” for a few families that hit
33%. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To compensate for any loss in tax revenue from these
changes, and to help face the growing debt problem of the US, I would support a
value added tax, but only as part of such a comprehensive reform of the tax
structure. Value added taxes have many attractive incidence features that can
be a valuable way to raise tax revenue in a system with low personal and corporate
income taxes. However, VAT taxes also have the potential to be rather easily
increased over time without close controls over such increases (see my
discussion of VATs in my post on 4/25).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Government spending rose a lot during the last year of the
Bush administration, and rose even more so during the year and one half of the
Obama administration. Instead of introducing additional stimulus packages and
further raising the cost of doing business, Congress and the President should
try to create an environment where companies, both large and small, and
entrepreneurs are recognized as crucial forces in a dynamic economy. Their
activities can help the American economy not only grow out of the economic
slowdown, but also raise its economic growth in the future that will greatly
improve the well being of future generations, and help meet a dangerous future
debt burden.</p>
