<p>Serious economic debate over the wisdom of minimum wages has
been going on for at lease 70 years, and the debate has been revived by
President Obama’s proposal to raise the US’ federal minimum wage to $9 per hour.
The two main issues debated are the effects of a higher minimum on employment
of the low skilled, and its effects on the degree of poverty. both theory and evidence indicate that higher minimums reduce employment for teenagers and other
workers with low productivity, and that it does little to alleviate poverty.
Neither conclusion, however, is without controversy, especially the employment
effect.</p>
<p>Federal minimums in the United States have never been higher
than to affect a rather small fraction of the working population, such as
teenagers, unskilled immigrants, and some others. The expectation from economic
theory is that when the minimum wage is raised above the wages that these low
skilled workers are receiving, some of them would become unemployed because
they would be priced out of the labor market. The challenges to this conclusion
have both theoretical and empirical aspects.</p>
<p>One old theoretical argument is that employment may not fall
if firms hiring low skilled workers have monopoly power in the labor market.
Yet the great majority of  
low skilled workers are employed in fast food establishments and other
retail and manufacturing sectors that face much competition even in local labor
markets. Another claim is that higher minimums mainly reduce the profitability
of the firms employing low skilled workers without have much effect on
employment. Perhaps that claim would apply to highly profitable companies, but
profit margins are generally thin in the typical firms employing the workers
affected by higher minimums. Since there is not much room for these margins to
go much lower without the firms going out of business, the firms affected try
to preserve their thin margins by cutting costs, including reducing employment
of low skilled workers. </p>
<p>Also argued is that higher wages shock firms into more
efficient behavior that offsets the effects on costs of the higher wages. That
claim too is not persuasive in the highly competitive sectors with much entry
and exit of firms that employ the great majority of low skilled workers. The
Economist in a recent article on minimum wages (issue of Feb. 6-23) refers to
the claim that higher minimum wages are good for employers because they reduce
worker turnover, which is costly to employers. But employers could raise wages
on their own if they believed that this reduced turnover enough to raise their
profits. In fact, the reduction in turnover is smaller, not larger, when higher
minimums force competitor firms also to raise their wages. For then the gain to
workers from staying with their jobs is lower, aside from the effects of higher
minimums in reducing employment options. </p>
<p>The great majority of the literature during past couple of
decades on the effects of higher minimum wages is empirical with little
theoretical discussion. Two eminent economists, David Card and Allen Krueger,
launched the first modern attack on the traditional conclusion that higher
minimums significantly reduce the employment of the low skilled. They studied
employment changes in fast food restaurants in adjacent states before and after
one of the states raises its minimum wage. They found essentially no effect on
employment, or sometimes even a slight positive effect. I wrote a Business Week
article at the time (1995, reprinted in The Economics of Life) that was harshly
critical of their study. In retrospect I believe my criticisms were too harsh,
for their study was pioneering, and stimulated a large amount of serious
empirical work using both time series changes in federal minimums, and state
differences in minimum wages.</p>
<p>Some of the more recent studies have supported the
Card-Krueger finding of little if any effects of “moderately” higher minimum
wages on employment, although the “majority” has tended to confirm the older
conclusion that a 10% increase in the minimum wage reduces teenage employment
by about 1to 3 per cent. A very recent study by Neumark, Salas, and Wascher
(January 2013] goes over a few recent studies challenging this conclusion. They
conclude, as Neumark and Wascher did in their 2008 book, Minimum Wages,
regarding earlier evidence, that the recent evidence does not overturn the
conclusion that higher minimum wages do significantly reduce employment of
vulnerable groups, like teenagers.</p>
<p>France has one of the highest minimum wages relative to average
wages in the developed world, so its record is particularly interesting to
analyze. Several studies by the French economists Guy Laroque and Bernard
Salanie support the view that higher minimum wages significantly reduce
employment of married women and young persons. Consistent with their analysis,
France has the highest minimum in Europe, and also has unusually high
unemployment rates of younger persons, especially Moslem males. </p>
<p>Some proponents of higher minimum wages indicate that while
they believe that small to “moderate’ increases in minimum wages have
negligible effects on unemployment and employment, they admit that sizable
increases in the minimum wage would significantly reduce employment. Obviously
small changes usually have small effects, but this view appears to be claiming
that the employment effect per each one per cent increase in the minimum wage
gets bigger as the overall increase in the minimum wage gets larger. This is
not at all obvious, and depends on complex substitution and complementarity
relations with skilled labor and other inputs.</p>
<p>Even if one accepts the conclusion, as I do, that higher
minimum wages lowers employment significantly of vulnerable groups like
teenagers, this conclusion does not imply that minimum wages are an ineffective
way to fight poverty. Higher minimum wages might still increase the overall
earnings of the poor because the higher earnings of those who manage to keep
their jobs dominates the negative effects on the earnings of workers who lose
their jobs. </p>
<p>That conclusion too is not justified because minimum wages are ill
suited to raise the incomes of the poor, partly because it targets individual
earnings rather than family incomes. Posner gives several reasons why low
earnings of individuals and low family incomes are only loosely connected.</p>
<p>There is an additional reason why higher minimums may not
help poor families. By raising the costs of employers, higher minimums induce
competitive firms to raise their prices. I pointed out earlier that the
principal employers of low skilled workers are fast food establishments and
other producers of cheaper goods. Poorer families are also the main consumers
of fast foods and other low-end goods and services that employ low skilled
workers. As a result, low-income families are hit by two bullets: some of their
members find it harder to get jobs, and they face a higher cost of the goods
they consume. </p>
