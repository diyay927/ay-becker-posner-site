<p>Colleges in the United States, and in most other countries
as well, vary enormously in the quality of education provided, their cost, and
their overall efficiency. The over 3000 American colleges compete fiercely for
students in terms of tuition, quality of faculty and student bodies, athletic
programs, student loans, student grants, and in many other ways. Even though
many academics complain about the distortions of business advertisements, the
catalogues and other “information” provided by many colleges and universities
make lots of advertising look like models of accuracy and probity.</p>
<p>Therefore, to better assess different colleges, high school students,
especially those from more educated and financially better off families, spend
considerable time and effort in gathering information about colleges. All potential
college students can use good information about courses offered, performance of
the student body on standardized tests and other information about the students
who have attended, the availability of student aid, and the earnings of
graduates.</p>
<p>The market has responded to this interest in knowing about
colleges by providing guides, rating system, and other school information.
These include the well-known US News and Washington Monthly’s rankings, and
many lesser known surveys and rankings that range from the frivolous to the informative.</p>
<p>The federal government has a role to play in making readily
available many kinds of information useful to students applying to colleges.
The government also could help, at least up to a point, by requiring colleges
to release relevant information that they may try to keep hidden, such as
default rates on student loans, earnings of graduates, dropout rates, and the
like. This and other information would be particularly valuable to students
from poorer families since recent studies show that these students, even those
with very good school records and high scores on achievement tests, are not
well informed about different colleges, partly because they put relatively little
time into their college choices.</p>
<p>I do not see any good role for the federal government in
providing rankings of colleges, as proposed by President Obama, and discussed
by Posner. Competition among private market providers of ranking and other
college information is far more likely to give students what they want in
making their choices. To be sure, market-driven information tends to neglect
information that students are not interested in knowing, even when the
information might be helpful in their college choices.  But the federal government is unlikely to be efficient
in discovering this information, and presumably students will give it little
weight in making their school decisions.</p>
<p>Student debt has grown rapidly during the past 25 years, due
to the rapid increase in school tuition during this time period, the
significant subsidy to most loans, and the growth in high school graduates who
attend college. Even though many in the media and elsewhere are complaining
about this expansion in student loans, the average student loan of about
$26,000 is not large relative to the average income of college graduates of
about $70,000. Young families often take on mortgage debt that is twice or even
a larger fraction of their earnings.</p>
<p>There is a legitimate concern about those persons with much
larger student debt, and about those who make much less than the average
college graduate, such as students who drop out of college, or who attended proprietary
schools. The federal law that excludes student loans from personal bankruptcies
makes the burden for these students still much harder to manage.</p>
<p>The president addresses this problem by proposed various
changes in the student loan program, including a move toward a more universal
income-contingent repayment system. I have supported income contingent loan
programs because returns on investments in a college education are risky. Risky
business investments are generally financed by equities rather than debt, and
an income-contingent repayment system is more like equity than debt financing
of student investments.</p>
<p>Income contingent loans appeal least to students who expect
to earn a good income, such as graduates of medical, business, or engineering
schools, because the repayment “taxes” on their earnings would be higher. This
is why in order to get a balanced demand for such loans from both high and low
earners, repayment rates should begin to decline after earnings exceed a
certain level. </p>
<p>College is still a very good economic deal relative to their
alternatives for the great majority of college graduates, including most of those
with sizable loans. The returns from college are not so good for some students with
lower abilities and poorer college preparation who come from poorer backgrounds, who do not attend colleges that help them much, and who take on too many loans.
These students would benefit from better information about what different colleges
have to offer, and from student loan systems that tie repayments to earnings.</p>
