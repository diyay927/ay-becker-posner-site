			My book <em>A Failure of Capitalism: The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression</em> was published a couple of weeks ago, but it had been completed on February 2. In order to bring the book up to date, reflecting events since then and also some fresh thinking and reading on my part, I have decided to do some update blogging of the book under the auspices of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>, which hosts a number of blogs. The address of my <em>Atlantic </em>blog is http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/richard_posner/. The entries are, as in the Becker-Posner blog, in reverse chronological order. The first two entries have now been posted.

I will not be using any material from the Becker-Posner blog in the <em>Atlantic </em>blog (the name of which is A Failure of Capitalism), or vice versa. My blogging with Professor Becker will therefore be unaffected.
