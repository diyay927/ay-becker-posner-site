			The patent system (I concentrate on patents) is supposed to
encourage innovation, the foundation of economic progress. It does this by
giving patent recipients exclusive control for a specified period of time over
use of their patented goods, machinery, processes, or services. It has long
been recognized that patents impose costs on society since patents keep out
competition, so that the monopoly power of patent holders enables them to raise
prices and lower outputs. However, until recent years many other costs of the
patent system received little attention, including paradoxically that this
system might in fact discourage innovations.
<p>Posner has a very good discussion of many costs of a patent
system. These include not only the monopoly power given to patent recipients,
but also time-consuming and expensive patent litigation because of overlapping
patents, patent trolling to gain control of large numbers of patents not for
use but to force compensation through litigation, and the ability to patent
minor improvements over existing technologies. One additional important cost is
that companies in many developing countries, in particular China, do not worry
about patent infringement, and often produce much cheaper copies that undercut
patented products. These companies have an advantage over companies in
developed countries that refrain from producing patented products because they
fear punishment from the courts for infringing patent rights.</p>
<p>Patent infringement lawsuits, copying by companies in
developing countries, and many other obstacles to profiting from innovations
under the modern patent system not only discourage certain types of patent
applications, but may also reduce the incentive to innovate itself. Why apply
for a patent if the information in the application makes it easier to produce
copies? Moreover, the potential profit from an innovation might be more than
dissipated through lengthy patent litigation that involves also the risk of
large fines- as in the recently imposed fine on Samsung of over $1 billion for
allegedly copying software patented by Apple. </p>
<p>The various harmful effects of the patent and copyright
systems encouraged Arnold Plant, an English economist, to publish over 75 years
ago two influential articles on why England and other countries would be better
off without patents and copyrights. Among other things, he argued that the
temporary monopoly power given to patent holders often led to inefficiently
high prices and reduced output of patented goods, that many persons would
continue to invent even if they could not patent their inventions, and that
patents distort innovations in favor of goods and processes that can be
patented and away from innovations that cannot be patented. His favorite
example of the latter is basic research in the sciences that produced the
theory of relativity, the theory of evolution, and in more modern times our
understanding of DNA and genes. He believed that the patent system induced some
creative scientists to work in areas that could be patented rather than on
basic scientific research that could not be patented.</p>
<p>Although ending the patent system is a clean solution to all
the problems induced by modern patenting, it clearly is not desirable given the
importance of industries like the pharmaceutical industry. Since this industry
spends on average hundreds of millions of dollars bringing to market a
successful drug, pharmaceutical companies would not invest such large sums
without the protection of patents (or without other benefits). Probably the
best solution would be to maintain the patent system on drugs and a few other
products that are expensive to innovate and cheap to copy, and eliminate
patents on everything else. In particular, this means eliminating patents in
the software industry, the source of much of the patent litigation and patent
trolling.</p>
<p>I admit it is not clear where to draw the line between what
should and should not be patentable. However, one can start by eliminating the
ability to patent software, and go on from there to prune the number and type
of inventions and innovations that are eligible for patent protection. Plant
was not right about the desirability of eliminating the patent system, but he
erred in the right direction. We should try to move much closer to where he
wanted to be, and away from the present system.</p>
