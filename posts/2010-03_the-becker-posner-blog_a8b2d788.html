<p class="MsoNormal">The over $800 billion American fiscal stimulus package is
enormously unpopular in many quarters. Yet for others, including some
well-known economists, a second package is needed to make unemployment decline
faster. It is very difficult to give a definite answer to the effectiveness of
what has been spent so far, but I believe both theory and quite limited
empirical evidence suggest that it is likely having a small “multiplier”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to simple Keynesian models, the rationale for
increased government spending during a recession is straightforward. If
governments employ underutilized labor and capital when they spend more, that
provides an immediate boost to employment and output. A further stimulus comes
from the spending by the owners of the unemployed labor and capital who benefit
from the government spending. Their spending helps multiply the effects of the
government spending still further, and so does spending by the recipients of
this second round of spending. The total impact is the sum of all these
separate boosts, and its ratio to the initial level of government spending is
called the spending multiplier. A study by Dr. Christina Romer, Chair of the
Council of Economic Advisers, published shortly before she took office claimed
the spending multiplier during the recession at that time would be well over 1.0.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In reality, several major considerations neglected by this
Keynesian analysis suggest a rather different multiplier. There is often a long
delay between discussions of a fiscal stimulus, enactment of a law providing
for the stimulus, and the actual spending. Dr. Romer discussed the broad
dimensions of the current stimulus package even before she took her current
position, and Congress passed the law providing for about an $800 fiscal
stimulus shortly after President Obama took office. Yet it is now more than one
year later, and only about a half of the stimulus package has been spent. In
the meantime, the economy first hit bottom, and then has begun a strong
recovery in GDP, and a modest recovery in unemployment. The long lag between
discussion, enactment, and actual spending is an old criticism of fiscal
stimulus even by very committed Keynesians. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nor did the actual stimulus package voted by Congress
correspond very closely to the theory behind the multiplier from government
spending. Instead of being concentrated mainly on sectors that had suffered
large increases in unemployment, such as construction, the stimulus spending
was oriented toward many sectors that liberal members of the Democratic
controlled Congress wanted to greatly expand. These include healthcare,
schools, alternative energy sources, and medical and basic research. Some of
this spending may have considerable social value, but it provides little
stimulus since sectors like health, education, and wind power development were
not hit hard by the recession, and hence have had low levels of unemployment.
Government spending in these areas would tend mainly to bid labor away from
either the private sector, or other government programs, or raise the earnings
of those already employed. As a result, any multiplier from the stimulus
package is likely to be less than one, not greater than one.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even though the theory behind the multiplier has been around
for a long time, few studies credibly estimate multipliers from different kinds
of government spending. Part of the problem is that many other things are
usually also changing when government spending changes, so it is difficult to
find “natural” experiments where the effects of government spending are
isolated from changes in other important variables. Some of the relevant
factors that may be changing are prices, including wage rates and interest
rates, consumption, and private investment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Robert Barro of Harvard University has been estimating both
spending and tax multipliers from past episodes, not from the current one.
Using historical data obviously has many limitations from the point of view of
evaluating the current stimulus, but such an evaluation is difficult because many aspects of the American economy have
been changing during this recession along with stimulus spending, such as the
monies spent on bank bailouts. Barro's estimated spending multipliers are based
mainly on fluctuations in defense spending before, during, and after wars, such
as World War II and the Korean War.<span> 
</span>He reports in a recent Wall Street Journal article (February 23)
estimated spending multipliers over a two-year period following changes in
defense spending. These multipliers equal about 0.4 following the first year,
and 0.6 after two years. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They indicate sizable changes in overall GDP per $100
billion change in defense spending, but they also suggest that government
spending significantly crowds out either personal consumption spending, private
investment, or exports. Still, if these were the only effects of stimulus
packages, multipliers of about 0.6 would indicate that larger government
spending, such as the Obama stimulus package, can induce significant growth in
GDP, presumably especially when unemployment rates are high.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, greater spending has to be paid for eventually by
higher taxes, including inflation taxes, since governments are subject to long
term budget balance requirements, just as are households and businesses. Barro
also estimates tax multipliers based on the effects on GDP of changes in
average marginal tax rates from federal and state and local income taxes, and
social security payroll taxes. These tax multipliers are about -1.1, which
means that increases in marginal tax rates that raise tax revenue by say $300
billion would lower GDP by over $300 billion in the following year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Putting these estimated spending and tax multipliers
together, in recognition that government budgets have to be balanced
eventually, indicates that the Obama stimulus package on balance would have a
small, possibly even negative, overall effect on GDP. To be sure, these results
have to be qualified since changes in nondefense spending, as in this stimulus
package, may have larger multipliers than those estimated by Barro, although it
is not obvious why that should be so. Moreover, if the spending occurs in 2009
and 2010, and raises GDP for a few years during a recession, perhaps that is
worth any reductions in GDP that follows in later years when taxes are actually
increased to produce the budget balance (although much of that effect might be
anticipated earlier).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A few other discussions of the current stimulus package have
much rosier conclusions about its effects on employment and GDP. But these
estimates have little credibility because of the difficulties in disentangling
the stimulus effects from those of Fed and Treasury spending on bailouts, many
other factors that have been changing along with the stimulus spending, and the
intrinsic strengths of the private sector of the American economy<span>  </span>(see, for example, an article by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 15pt; font-family: Calibri; color: #001cf7;">Cogan, Taylor, and Wieland</span></span>
in the Wall Street Journal of September 17, 2009 for a discussion of some of
these factors).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My conclusion is that the Obama-Congress stimulus was an
attempt at reengineering government’s role in the economy that was badly
designed and executed relative to the alleged goal of giving a short-term
stimulus to the economy. Its design, and the general evidence on the effects of
spending fiscal stimulus, should make Americans wary of any attempt to pass a second
stimulus package, whatever form it takes.</p>
