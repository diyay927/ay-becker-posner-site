<h3>Price Gouging in the Wake of Hurricanes--Posner's Response to Comments</h3>
<p>There were many excellent comments. One asked who actually benefited from the shortage of gasoline resulting from Katrina and Rita--the gasoline dealers or the refiners? I had mentioned the first, Becker the second. Both gained, but the refiners more. The reason is, as one commenter noted, that once the gasoline station has sold all the gasoline stored on his premises and has to buy more from a refiner, he will have to pay the high price necessary to ration the limited output of the refiners, unless he has negotiated a fixed-price supply contract.</p>
<p>I was surprised by how many comments took issue with the basic proposition that price controls are inefficient. A number of questionable propositions, theoretical and empirical, were offered. For example, it was suggested that charging the market-clearing price in a shortage is inefficient because it is not the "equilibrium" price. I think what the commenter meant is that if the shortage is temporary, the price that clears the market will soon fall. But the point is that it <em>is </em>the market-clearing price. If a lower price is charged, supply will exceed demand and will have to be allocated by some nonprice method, such as queuing. It is quite right, as I had suggested in my post, that for people with low time costs, queuing may be preferable to paying a high (money) price. But the poorest people don't have cars, so they are not affected by a gasoline shortage. Above them are people of modest incomes, who can afford cars but are highly sensitive to gasoline prices; nevertheless, the number of people who would incur extreme hardship from having to pay an extra $2 or $3 a gallon for a few weeks is, I would guess, small (I would invite submission of evidence that it is large). Moreover, while their time costs may be low, they will not be zero. Queuing in a shortage situation can become extreme, because not knowing whether there will be any supply available people tend to queue when their need is not urgent, for example when they have a half-full gas tank but are unsure when, if they do not fill it now, they will be able to do so when the tank is almost empty. Fear of shortages also makes shortages worse and queuing longer by increasing hoarding. The worse that shortages are expected to be because of price controls, the more hoarding the expectation of shortages will induce--and so the shortages will be worse.</p>
<p>As I said in my post, in situations of extreme hardship, which I illustrated with the case of a shortage of human growth hormone and that one of the comments illustrated with the case of scarcity of organs for transplantation, the welfare effects of rationing by price may justify either nonprice rationing or a government subsidy to enable people of limited means to obtain a product much more likely to increase their welfare than that of affluent purchasers.</p>
<p>It should be noted also that some of the effects of shortages on the distribution of income and wealth are automatically corrected by the tax system: windfall profits of gasoline dealers and retailers are taxable as income, and so a part of them is in effect returned to the general public. More would be returned if an "excess profits" tax were imposed, as in World War II, in recognition of the enormous profits that shortages created by the nation's all-out war effect had generated for defense contractors.</p>
<p>One comment blamed the refiners for not having hardened their Gulf Coast refineries against catastrophic hurricanes. If they were negligent in failing to do so, this might conceivably support a tort suit to recover the refiners' windfall profits. (They would not be negligent if the expected benefits from such hardening did not exceed the costs.) For then there would be a sense in which the shortage was artifically induced. But the point does not support a general policy of imposing price controls during shortages.</p>
<p>One comment reported a rumor that Starbucks had charged $10 per bottle of water to firemen and police officers who responded to the 9/11 attacks in New York City, even though--the commenter said--there was no shortage of water. But the rumor, if true, describes a situation similar to that in the admiralty salvage case. The responders appear unexpectedly and need water; they don't have time to shop for it and anyway there are many more of them than are usually trying to buy water from a Starbucks store, and so its supply would quickly be depleted if it charged its normal price--so there <em>would </em>have been a shortage at that price. And, as one comment pointed out, price controls in shortage situations, for example in the form of fines for "price gouging," discourage merchants from stocking up with extra supplies for future emergencies. Keeping an inventory of items that will be demanded only in emergencies is extremely costly, and may be cost justifiable only if the merchant knows that should there be an emergency the items can be sold at a higher than normal price. This is an objection to a general windfall-profits tax.</p>
<p>Some of the comments challenge the most basic assumptions of a free-market society, such as that markets generally yield much more satisfactory allocative results than bureaucrats. One would think that the experience of communism would have disabused people of belief in the superior efficiency of "central planning." The issue is not philosophical--whether a market system of resource allocation is "just" or whether democracy should be used to allocate resources instead of markets because it is more--democratic. It is whether you like the consequences that "price gouging" laws would produce. The major consequences would be shortages, leading to nonprice rationing that would impose enormous costs, and thus augment and shift, rather than reduce, the price of the shortage item. I think the experience of queuing would change the minds of most intellectuals who think that resources should be allocated by nonprice methods.</p>
<p>Let me try finally to be more precise about the nature of the market failure in the admiralty salvage case. One comment suggested that the problem there is not monopoly at all, in the sense of an artifical scarcity, but transaction costs. In fact both monopoly and high transaction costs are present and they are related. The would-be rescuer creates an artifical scarcity by threatening to withhold supply (that is, refuse to rescue) unless the ship in distress agrees to the rescuer's exorbitant price--a monopoly price because it is based on the purchaser's lack of alternatives. However, the situation is actually one of bilateral monopoly because while the purchaser lacks alternatives, so does the seller; he has (at present) no other market for his rescue services than this particular ship in distress. Because price under bilateral monopoly is indeterminate within a broad range, negotiation (transaction) costs are high, which creates a particularly acute problem in a rescue situation in which time is of the essence. The case is completely different from that of the hurricane-induced gasoline shortage.</p>

<p>I am not sure if this was a response to my comment or to someone else's.  But if it was to mine, perhaps my original post was not clear.  When "price gouging" occurs, the price paid by consumers on the market IS higher than the equilibrium price.  The seller holds back supply and deliberately increases the price, betting that buyers will believe (wrongly) that the emergency has caused the market price to increase.  If the emergency has caused a breakdown in competition, or if the competing sellers raise prices in concert, then they can "gouge" the market and extract an undeserved premium.  This situation is similar to Posner's "salvage" example, and it is the reason for price gouging regulations.  Opportunistic behavior by sellers in an emergency can and does occur.</p>
<p>If there is a true shortage, that is not a price gouging situation.  That is simply a reduction in supply.  In a shortage, there is less justification to disturb the market, unless the scarce good is very important and very expensive, and it would be unjust to leave pricing to the market for the duration of the emergency.  For instance, if the price of heating oil spikes because of a short-lived emergency, it might be unconscionable to force poor people to choose between food and heat.  However, it might be preferable, economically, to give a subsidy, perhaps heating "vouchers," to poor people rather than impose a control on the market.<br/>

<div id="c074556">
<p>On the clarification of the admiralty salvage case, a clarification of my own:</p>
<p>I think that the situation is well described (at least statically) as a bilateral monopoly, as is the Starbuck's case, with the provisio that incentive effects are negligible because it is usually only by luck that the rescuer is near-by enough to effect the rescue (this may have been more true when admiralty law developed than it is today, when there may be some use to incentivizing people to become rescuers during storms etc.)</p>
<p>But the main point is that conceptualizing the situation as a bilateral monopoly does not get you admiralty law.  In the typical one-on-one Nash bargaining box, a 50-50 split is typically conceived as the "fair" solution and the split typically arrived at when the game is played iteratively.  (In single round games, of course, any outcome within the box could be achieved).  When you consider that the value being "split" in the salvage case is the value of the cargo PLUS the value of the crew's lives, it is clear that a 50-50 split is not what is meant in admiralty law by "fair price."</p>
<p>That is the main motivation to viewing the situation as a transaction costs problem, i.e., the high costs of ex ante bargaining which creates bilateral monopolies as you point out.  By conceptualizing admiralty law as what would result from a hypothetical negotiation behind a veil of ignorance, it is easier to see how you get to admiralty law's solution.</p>
<p>One might question whether such a negotiation would yield admiralty law when the incentive to rescue is so much lower than the value of the crew and cargo. Wouldn't you want to give everyone else a big incentive to rescue you (which of course cuts against the "fair" price idea). That seems plausible if incentive effects are a realistic possibility, but note that admiralty law requires ships in a position to rescue, to rescue. Admiralty law then can be conceived as a hypothetical insurance contract priced ex ante, which like any other contract you are obligated to perform (or pay the price for breaching).</p>

<p> I think the experience of queuing would cause both poor and rich citizens to recognize their common vulnerability to supply inefficiencies and feel a larger sense of solidarity with each other as they interact while waiting in line.</p>

<p>Yes, lets punish everybody so there is no incentive for people to save money for a rainy day, or work harder and more efficiently so that lifes curveballs don't cause so much damage.  Then we can all blow our money on booze and hot women because we'll all be in the same crappy boat no matter what we do.  But hey, we will have a wonderful sense of togetherness.</p>

CH,</p>
<p>I traveled in East Germany during the summer of '90 - less than a year after the wall fell.</p>
<p>The place was a poster of "lack of incentive," with unfinished and unambitious projects littering the mostly undeveloped countryside.</p>
<p>The people had a totally warped (from Western perspective) picture of the necessities of life, rent and food were virtually free, anything else was astronomically expensive.</p>
<p>And, yes, when they did get some money (as they did while I was there with the east marks = west marks declaration), booze and hot women were on the top of the list alongside western cars and travel (to seek more booze and hot women, mostly.)</p>

<p>I haven't researched this, but probably a lot of the oil companies (both refiners and distributors) use a FIFO inventory cost flow assumption.  In periods of rapidly rising prices that results in revenues being "matched" with acquisition costs that are lower than replacement costs would be.  This leads to increased profits which are totally artifacts of the accounting principles used.  When prices fall then profits are reduced because revenues are being matched with acquisition costs that are higher than replacement costs.  This is true even though the company may have exactly the same mark-up on sales both when profits are inflated and when they are deflated.  Before anyone can start discussing "price gouging" he needs to adjust for the amount of "windfall profits" that are due solely to this artifact of accounting.  If "gouging" means anything, it has to be related to mark-up, not profit.</p>

<p>if you stop to think about who is "rich," it's not necessarily the sterotypical, moustachioed, bourgeois, gold-bug so despised by socialists.  in the wake of katrina, the "rich" were those who possessed 1) the foresight to have removed themselves from the area, 2) boats, or 3) guns.</p>
<p>true, one might not have had the material resources beforehand to buy emergency supplies or a plane ticket on a whim.  but any industrious person -- such as the out-of-stater who showed up with supplies -- could have gone down to his local bank, taken out a loan, and told them "i'll be back after the 'cane with double your money."</p>
<p>that people relied on politicians to save them only goes to show the error in thinking that government will deliver.  </p>
<p>a currency-based price system trumps all other methods of organizing knowledge, labor, and capital by rewarding those who have best planned for future consumption and can best provide for present consumption.  markets create informational (and thus investment) incentive structures unmatched by any political system of communal decisionmaking.</p>
<p>as for queuing, the idea that people will line up, hold hands, and gain empathy from their common plight is naive, to say the least.  at some point, the rewards of violence exceed its costs.  peaceful queues in communist russia were enforced by an oppressive regime and the omnipresent threat of violence.</p>
<p>the question then becomes, whom shall we reward? -- the people who saved and invested so as to provide in times of crisis, or those who are willing to take by force?</p>

<p>When "price gouging" occurs, the price paid by consumers on the market IS higher than the equilibrium price.</p>
<p>Actually, this point (as Posner correctly pointed out) is patently false. The writer misunderstands what equilibrium entails, ie: the intersection of supply and demand curves. The refiners did not, as the writer suggested, conspire to restrict supply in a time of emergency, the high price rather reflects the effects of a shock to supply. The market is clearing at that price. Moreover, the price is not contrived by sellers acting in concert or conspiring to raise it, issues which are resolved through antitrust policy (again by market intervention). There is no evidence that this emergency has caused such a break down in competition  one would presume that the temporary profits created from such a shortage would induce (far better than price controls) increased output, and more hearty competition to boot. </p>
<p>In reality, the writers logic bespeaks a simple underlying fallacy, often made but scarce recognized, that there is some sort of normal or just equilibrium. The fallacy underlies the price-gouging laws, and many other unwarranted interventions in the market that have spanned the ages. The writer would not shirk from intervening to halt what he considers to be unjust profits  undeserved premiums I believe he said  through enacting price controls, in this case, the price-gouging laws. Posners frustration hinges upon this idea: that the use of these laws is an attempt to forcibly clear the market which ignores the consequences and incentives created. He rightfully points out that markets yield more successful results than bureaucratic regulations; such regulations quite often do more harm than good. </p>
<p>The fact is, more vigorous enforcement of dormant price-gouging laws may be rhetorically appealing, but it will surely exacerbate rather than resolve, the problem. <br/>

And senslessly burn oil together.  I'm on the far left here, and to advocate such senseless waste of fossil fuels for a sense of solidarity to me seems rather dangerous to our species long term survival.</p>
