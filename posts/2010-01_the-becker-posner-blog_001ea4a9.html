<p class="MsoNormal">Invention of the telegraph and telephone in the nineteenth
century had revolutionary impacts on the speed of communications among
individuals separated sometimes by vast distances. The Internet and wireless transmission
has not only vastly extended the ease of communicating quickly, but also
provides quick access to information on a scale far surpassing anything
available before. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“Googling” is a new word not only in English but in many
other languages as well that means using Internet search engines to discover
information on an endless number of subjects. These  include finding
the cheapest online price for tennis rackets, cars, hotels, and many other
goods and services, finding a time series on GDP per capita for the United
States, China, and other countries, discovering when a famous phrase was first
used, finding out what is contained in the House of Representatives’ and the
Senate’s versions of the health “reform” bills, reading criticisms of government
policies, getting email addresses for particular individuals, and tens of
thousands of other purposes. I would find it virtually impossible to fit
posting on our blog into a busy teaching, research, and speaking schedule
without quick access through the Internet to generally reliable information.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although newspapers have frequently been subject to various
forms of censorship, Internet access is affected by hackers as well as by
censors. We were forced to change our website address and the technical manager
of this blog because the old website was hacked so much that posting of
commentary became impossible (we do not know who was doing this). Of course,
various governments try to deny their citizens access to websites that they
consider too critical of government policies. A few weeks ago I received an
email from someone in China complaining that he and his friends no longer could
access our website because it was being blocked by the government. I was
surprised by the claim, and yet a little flattered that we were considered
important enough to be blocked. I suggested he try our new website address, and
he discovered it was available with no problems. Access was prevented by
hackers on our old website rather than by the government.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Google recently complained about Chinese censorship, and
claimed that hackers from China gained access to gmail accounts of some persons
critical of government policies. As a result, Google threatened to shut down
its Chinese website. It is difficult to determine when the censorship goes so
far that the benefits of making the Google search engine (or other online
facilities) available to the Chinese population is no longer worth accepting
the censorship. My own view is that censorship has to be very extensive and
destructive before the benefits of withdrawing Google exceed the costs to the
population of losing access to an important information search engine. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This weighing of benefits and costs is especially pertinent
since many Chinese Internet users, and presumably also those in other countries
with extensive censorship of the Internet, have learned how to “scale the
wall”. That is, they discovered ways to get around Internet restrictions by
using proxies, virtual private networks, and other tools that allow computers
to access the Internet through remote servers located outside China.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The strong efforts of some countries to try to block
Internet access to articles and discussions that their governments do not want
their citizens to see indicates the scope of the knowledge and information the
Internet makes available that was unavailable in the past. This leads me to
conclude that generally Google and other companies experiencing censorship
should stick it out. However, perhaps they should fund research on finding
additional ways to “scale the wall”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During this financial crisis, various financial markets have
been criticized, some of them justifiably, as being much less efficient than
had been claimed. Nevertheless, search engines, social networks over the
Internet, like Face Book and Twitter, apps, and other electronic forms of
communication, have greatly improved the efficiency of many markets, including
financial markets. For example, the open outcry system on stock and futures
exchanges to buy and sell securities, like the New York Stock Exchange or the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), was made obsolete by much faster and more
efficient electronic communication (see Leo Melamed’s book, “For
Crying Out Loud” for a fascinating discussion of the battles to get the CME to
go electronic). Retail and other companies continue to expand their online
presence and websites in recognition of the growing share of their business and
sales that is conducted online. Persons in small towns with only a few stores
often now have access to the same variety of goods and to the price competition
that used to be available only to residents of large cities, where many stores
competed for their business.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Many persons lament the decline of newspapers and magazines
due to the migration of help wanted ads and other advertisements to the
Internet. Some politicians and public intellectuals have even proposed greater
subsidies to newspapers in order to slow down their decline. Clearly, top
papers like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, and
Washington Post often have in depth reporting on various subjects seldom found
on television or radio. However, the Internet has a greater variety of news
presentations and articles on specialized subjects, and much more up to date reporting,
than is available even in the best newspapers. The Internet has been remarkable
in being able to tap into the desire of people from all walks of life to write,
through blogs, social networks, and other ways. Hundreds of economists have blogs,
although many are not very good, and the same is true for other fields. Some blogs
compile the scholarly citations of other individuals who are blogging, in order
to give readers at least one measure of their authority and reliability.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am old fashioned enough to read three newspapers in hard
copy each day, but the overwhelming majority of young people seldom read any
major newspapers. This difference between the young and old in their reading
habits predicts a continuing further decline in newspaper circulation, and a
further migration of news reporting and opinion pieces to the Internet. On the
whole, this is a good development from the point of view of increasing
competition among news and opinion sources, although it is sad to see the
decline of an industry that has been so crucial historically in providing
information and preserving political freedoms.</p>
