			The rise of the Internet has created a host of social, economic, political, and regulatory issues, a few of which we address in this week�s postings. (Another, at present under consideration by the Supreme Court in the <em>Grokster </em>case, is copyright infringement by means of file sharing.) One that is naturally near to our heart concerns proposals to regulate blogging, either formally or through voluntary adoption of ethical standards. Many blogs are electronic counterparts of newspapers, magazines, and other advertiser-supported �mainstream media,� and the argument is that since the mainstream media have adopted ethical standards concerning such matters as reliance on anonymous sources and retraction of errors (with electronic media such as television stations subject to formal regulation), so should bloggers.

The idea of parity among media is attractive, since exempting the producer of a close substitute of a taxed or regulated product from taxation or regulation tends to promote inefficiency; the exemption operates as a subsidy. The parity issue is starkly presented by the question whether to tax Internet transactions, discussed below. With respect to blogs, the contention is that exempting them from ethical or other informal (or formal) regulation subsidizes their competition with the mainstream media. Not that they are or would be totally exempt from controls over content; there is no legal exemption for a blog that defames someone, invades the person�s right of privacy, exhibits child pornography, reveals classified information, infringes copyright, or otherwise violates generally applicable laws, though in many cases the bloggers will not have sufficient resources to make suing them for money damages an attractive course of action. But there is no compulsion on bloggers to comply with the ethical standards applicable to the conventional media. Moreover, they face less market pressure to comply with ethical standards than the conventional media, because they generally are not supported by advertising revenues (though this is changing) and thus don�t have to worry about offending advertisers�or for that matter viewers, since bloggers do not charge for visiting their sites.

Nevertheless I think this �exemption� of blogging from the ethical standards applicable to the mainstream media makes good economic sense because of economic and technological differences between those media and the �blogosphere.� There are vastly more bloggers than there are newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations. In fact, there are some 10 million blogs, though most of them are personal rather than oriented to news and opinion�yet there are doubtless thousands of the latter. The large number is related to the fact that there is no set-up or operating expense for blogging except telecommunications line charges and, of course, the opportunity cost of the blogger�s time. As a result not only of the large number or blogs but of the speed of transmission and the fact that many bloggers are far more specialized than journalists, the blogosphere pools information with extraordinary completeness and rapidity, in a speeded-up version of Friedrich Hayek�s well-attested model of how the economic market pools information efficiently despite its decentralized character, its lack of a master coordinator. The blogosphere is a larger and faster-paced network than even the global marketplace. This means that errors in a blog, to the extent they concern matters of public interest and concern, are corrected almost instantaneously. Not only by other bloggers, but by the bloggers� readers, who post comments to the blog; the comments become a further part of the information network.

There is also greater political diversity in the blogosphere than in the mainstream media, because a conventional journalist�s career appeals disproportionately to liberals

The self-correcting machinery of the blogosphere is more efficient than the internal fact-checking departments of conventional media enterprises. This is not only because many more people (not only the bloggers, but also, as I have just noted, their audience, which can communicate with them instanteously by means of the comment feature that most blogs enable) are watching out for mistakes; it is also because corrections are disseminated virtually instantaneously throughout the network. In contrast, even when the mainstream media catch mistakes, it may, especially in the case of the print media, take days or weeks to communicate a retraction to the public. The process is especially deficient in the case of newspaper retractions, which are printed inconspicuously and, in all likelihood, rarely read.

Given these differences between blogging and the mainstream media, the case for imposing ethical standards on bloggers is weak. Moreover, there is no way in which thousands or millions of bloggers could agree to adhere to a set of standards, whereas such (benign) collusion may be feasible in a highly concentrated media industry, such as the newspaper industry.

A criticism of blogging that has some merit is that there is less advance filtering than in the case of the mainstream media, which because of fear of offending advertisers (more precisely, the advertisers� customers and so derivatively the advertiers) engage in a degree of self-censorship, much of it desirable�censoring out hate speech, wild rumors, and fantastic conjectures and misinformation. Blogging is less constrained and there is a valid concern that it encourages and reinforces antisocial tendencies. The problem is not limited to blogging but includes other uses of the Internet, such as chat rooms. It is not, however, a problem amenable to solution or even alleviation by a program of promoting the adoption of voluntary ethical standards, and there are practical as well as legal obstacles to official censorship. There may also be an actual social value in allowing antisocial elements to blow off stream�and by doing so to identify themselves to law enforcement and intelligence agencies, which can monitor blogs and chat rooms for dangerous movements. What is more, self-censorship motivated simply by a concern with avoiding offense may impair the marketplace of ideas by excluding heterodox ideas and perpetuating comfortable myths.

A genuine externality created by the Internet that may call for some kind of government regulation is the phenomenon of �spam.� Spam is advertising (broadly understood to include the various scams that seem to occupy a significant segment of spam space) that is emailed to people�s computers. Because the cost of spamming is very low, enormous volumes of spam are emailed despite a very low response rate, the explanation being that the lower the cost of advertising, the lower the break-even response rate is. Something like 75 percent of all email is spam, and this figure is expected to rise to 95 percent by next year in the absence of regulation.

Spam imposes costs (without offsetting benefits) of two kinds. First, most of it is of no interest whatsoever to recipients and some of it is downright offensive; hence receipt imposes a cost. (An earlier example of the first cost was faxed advertisements, which cost the recipient the paper the fax was printed on.) That in itself does not differentiate spam sharply from many other forms of advertising, such as junk mail, but the bother of discarding junk mail is trivial compared to having to pick through a flood of spam to find the emails one wants to read. In the case of much other advertising, moreover, such as the advertising one finds in newspapers and magazines and on television, the recipient is compensated for having to encounter unwanted advertising, in the form of a lower price for a tied product that he wants to consumer, such as �free� television (i.e., paid for by advertisers). Second, the cost of filtering out spam (the demand for such filtering being further evidence that spam imposes net costs on most of the people who receive it) to the computer industry, and of �binning� in in hard drives and servers, is already in the billions of dollars a year, for which the spammers don�t pay.

Spam thus creates a negative externality, a form of pollution. True, spam is not completely worthless�if (setting aside the scams) it generated no sales at all, it would be abandoned as an advertising medium. But the worthwhile spam can be preserved by a system in which spam is allowed to be sent to people who subscribe to the receipt of either all spam or particular categories of spam.

A different kind of externality has been created by the federal law (the Internet Tax Freedom Act, enacted in 1998) that bars state and local taxation of sales made over the Internet. The effect is to divert sales from conventional retail outlets to Internet sellers, such as Amazon.com. The exemption of e-commerce from normal taxes operates as a subsidy of that commerce. The most frequently heard arguments for the exemption are, first, that it is necessary to encourage the �infant industry� of e-commerce, and second that it is necessary to prevent a further growth of government. I find neither argument convincing. An infant-industry argument may make a little bit of sense for a country that has a promising industrial future but cannot finance the start-up costs of industry other than by preventing import competition, i.e., forcing consumers to finance those costs by paying supracompetitive prices. (Just a little bit, at most, because the global financial market is huge and highly efficient and therefore should be able to finance any promising commercial venture.) But there has never been difficulty in financing Internet-related ventures, even after the bursting of the dot-com bubble. And the �feeding the beast� argument is unconvincing because state and local taxation, unlike federal taxation, is effectively constrained by competition, since businesses and individuals can move with relative ease from high-tax to low-tax states. If states obtained substantial revenues from taxing Internet sales, there would be pressure to reduce tax rates. Banning state and local taxation of e-commerce seems a gratuitous blow to federalism.

In summary, I see no pressing need for imposing ethical standards on bloggers, but controls over spamming, and a repeal of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, deserve serious consideration.
