<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">British
Petroleum’s drilling accident in the Gulf of Mexico this past April is the
latest of several recent disastrous events for which the country, or the world,
was unprepared. Setting aside terrorist attacks, where the element of surprise
is part of the plan, that still leaves the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004,
Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the global economic crisis that began in 2008 (and has
been aggravated by Greece's recent financial collapse), and the earthquake in
Haiti last year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">The
reaction to the latest accident has been surprising. Oil spills and underwater
drilling accidents are common, and despite the media hype it is too soon to
tell whether this one will prove to be the biggest yet. The amount of oil
leaked so far is substantially less than the amount spilled or leaked in
previous accidents, including at least one in the Gulf of Mexico.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">It
is also surprising that so much criticism has been directed at the Obama
Administration, and indeed against Obama personally. Most of the criticism is
absurd—his failure to react emotionally, and his inability to “just plug the
hole,” are not personal or professional failings. The Minerals Management
Service in the Department of Interior does seem to have been asleep at the
switch, but Obama unlike his immediate predecessor cannot be criticized as
being hostile to regulation—if anything, he has too much faith in it. MMS is a
small and obscure agency far below the horizon of a president’s supervision. No
president can eliminate all pockets of incompetence in the vast federal
government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">It
is possible that the number of recent disasters has created a public sense that
something is wrong with government: that it ought to be able to prevent all disasters.
But this is an unrealistic expectation. Everything conspires against a
government’s being able to protect its people against disasters, whether
natural or man-made. A factor that retards prevention of man-made disasters is
the rapid and relentless advance of technology. Regulation lags innovation. The
Federal Reserve, Treasury Department, and SEC were no more able to keep abreast
of advances in financial engineering than MMS was to keep abreast of advances
in drilling for oil at very great depths under water. Slack regulation
encourages private companies to adopt a high-risk business model. Risk and
return tend to be positively correlated, in finance because risky loans command
higher interest rates and in underwater drilling because risk abatement is
costly. Business is particularly reluctant to take preventive measures against
unlikely disasters because they do not pose a serious near-term threat. If
there is a 1 percent annual probability of a disastrous drilling accident or
financial collapse, the probability that the disaster will occur any time in
the next 10 years is only 10 percent. Business managers have finite planning
horizons just like politicians.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">Of
course, if the consequences of a disaster would be very grave, the fact that
the risk is low is not a good reason to ignore it. But there is a natural
tendency to postpone taking costly preventive action against dangers that are
only likely to occur at some uncertain point in the future (“sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof,” as the Bible says), especially if prevention is
expensive, if the probability and often the consequences of disaster cannot be
estimated with any confidence, if remediation after the fact seems like a
feasible alternative to preventing disaster in the first place—and because
there is so much else to do in the here and now than worry about remote
eventualities. The overcautious business will lose profits, investors, and
staff to its bolder competitors; the overcautious regulator will be harassed by
politicians pressured by business, labor, and other interest groups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">All
the factors that I’ve identified came together to enable the economic crisis,
despite abundant warnings from reputable sources, including economists and
financial journalists. Risky financial practices were highly profitable, and
giving them up would have been costly to financial firms and their executives
and shareholders. The Federal Reserve and most academic economists believed
incorrectly that in the event of a crash, remedial measures—such as cutting
interest rates—would suffice to jump-start the economy. Meanwhile, depending on
how they were compensated, many financial executives had a limited horizon;
they were not worried about a collapse years down the road because they
expected to be securely wealthy by then. Similarly, elected officials have
short time horizons for policy; with the risk of a financial collapse believed
to be low, and therefore a meltdown unlikely in the immediate future, they had
little incentive to push for costly preventive measures, and this in turn
discouraged the appointed officials of the Federal Reserve and other regulatory
agencies from taking such measures. Finally, with no reliable probability
estimate of a financial collapse available, it seemed prudent to wait and see,
hoping that with the passage of time at least some of the uncertainty about
risks to the economy would dissipate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">The
BP oil leak reveals a similar pattern, though not an identical one. One
difference is that the companies involved must have known that in the event of
an accident on a deepwater rig prompt and effective remedies for an oil leak
would be unlikely—meaning that there was no reliable alternative to preventing
an accident. But the risk of such an accident could not be quantified, and it
was believed to be low because there hadn't been many serious accidents
involved in deepwater drilling. (No one knew how low; the claim by BP chief
executive Tony Hayward that the chance of such an accident was "one in a
million" was simply a shorthand way of saying that the company assumed the
risk was very small.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">But
other causal factors were similar in the leak and the financial crisis. If
deepwater oil drilling had been forbidden or greatly curtailed, the sacrifice
of corporate profits and of consumer welfare (which is dependent on low
gasoline prices) would have been great. Elected representatives did not want to
shut down deepwater drilling over an uncertain risk of a disastrous spill, and
this reluctance doubtless influenced the response (or lack of it) of the civil
servants who do the regulating. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">The
horizon of the private actors was foreshortened as well. Stockholders often
don't worry about the risks taken by the firms in which they invest, because by
holding a diversified portfolio of stocks and other financial assets an
investor can largely insulate himself from risks taken by any particular firm.
Managers worry more about the fate of their company because they often are
heavily invested in it terms both of human capital and of reputation. But they rarely
are held personally liable for the debts of the firms they oversee and, more
important, the danger to their own livelihood posed by seemingly small risks is
not enough to discourage risk-taking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">Two
final problems illuminate the nation’s vulnerability to disasters. First, it is
very hard for anyone to get credit for preventing a low-probability disaster.
Because such a disaster was unlikely to occur, the benefits of taking action
beforehand could not be assessed unless the preventive action took the form of
a dramatic last-minute save. Had the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in
the early 2000s rather than lowering them, it might have averted the financial
collapse in 2008 and the ensuing global economic crisis. But we wouldn't have
known that. All that people would have seen was a recession brought on by high
interest rates. Officials bear the political costs of preventive measures but
do not usually reap the rewards. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">The
second problem is that there are so many risks of disaster that they can't all
be addressed without bankrupting the world many times over. In fact, they can’t
even be anticipated. In my 2004 book <em>Catastrophe:
Risk and Response</em>, I discussed a number of disaster possibilities. Yet I
did not consider volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, or financial bubbles, simply
because none of those seemed likely to precipitate catastrophes. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 12pt;"><span style="color: black;">It
would be nice to be able to draw up a complete list of disaster possibilities,
rank them by expected cost, decide how much we want to spend on preventing each
one, and proceed down the list until the total cost of prevention equals the
total expected cost averted. But that isn't feasible. Many of the probabilities
are unknown. The consequences are unknown. The costs of prevention and
remediation are unknown. And anyway, governments won't focus on remote possibilities,
however ominous in expected-cost terms. A politician who proposed a campaign of
preventing asteroid collisions with Earth, for example, would be ridiculed and
probably voted out of office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
