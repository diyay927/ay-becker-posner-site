<p class="MsoNormal">After many decades of hopelessness, there are finally grounds
for believing that sub-Saharan Africa may be close to taking off toward
sustained economic growth. Africa has rebounded from the worldwide recession
faster than many other nations. The International Monetary Fund estimates that
African GDP rose by 4.7 per cent in 2009, and the Fund forecasts that Africa’s
growth will increase still further to almost 6 per cent in 2010. The rate of
economic progress is not uniform in all the African economies, but these are
impressive figures for a continent that has disappointed for so long.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Several factors explain why Africa’s future looks rather
bright. Probably number one is the continuing discovery in Africa of minerals
and fossil fuels that are demanded by China, India, and other countries as
world economic growth picks up. Experts estimate that the recently discovered
coal deposits in Mozambique are the largest new coal reserves since the major
finds in Australia during the 1960s. Oil reserves in Nigeria, Ghana, and other
parts of Africa constitute more than 10% of the world’s reserves of oil, and
South Africa has 40% of the world’s gold. Africa also has about one third of
the world’s cobalt- a mineral used to prepare <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism">magnetic</a>, wear-resistant, and
high-strength <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy">alloy</a>s- and many
other minerals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Africa exports natural resources primarily to the rapidly
developing countries like China, and to the US. For example, Africa’s trade
with China has multiplied several fold during the past decade to reach more
than 12 percent of total African exports, on par with Africa’s trade with the
US.<span>  </span>Trade with India, Korea, and
Brazil, although much smaller, is also growing at fast rates.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Governments in many African countries generally adopted a
socialist approach to direction of their economies when they became independent
nations after World War II. At that time, even many economic experts considered
socialism and government management of an economy, as practiced very
differently in the Soviet Union, China, and India, to be the best approach to
economic development. Yet government control led to widespread inefficiency and
corruption in Africa (and elsewhere) since these governments had neither the skills nor the
incentives to conduct honest and effective public administration of the
economy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, attitudes of African leaders toward markets and
private business began to change a couple of decades ago, in part because the
socialist approach failed. Also important was the rapid economic growth
experienced by the Asian tigers, China, India, and Chile as these nations
shifted toward greater roles for the private sector and smaller economic roles
for government. Democracy has also become stronger in some African countries,
although strongmen and other undemocratic leaders still are prominent in many
African countries.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span>While some
optimism about Africa’s future is warranted, its future is not assured because
Africa still faces important problems. Yes, the private sector in mobile
phones, natural resources, and elsewhere has grown a lot in many African
countries, but the expansion of private companies has often taken the form of
crony capitalism rather than competitive capitalism. By crony capitalism I mean
that governments give special protected positions to favored companies in
important sectors of the economy rather than allowing competition among
companies to determine who are the winners and losers. Crony capitalism is
partly the result of a continuing excessive role of the government in the
economy. At the same time it encourages government corruption because companies
compete politically to obtain these favored positions, partly by bribing
government officials to favor them. Crony capitalism may be better than
socialist direction of an economy, but is is far inferior to competitive
capitalism.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During the past 30 years, fertility has fallen in all
regions of the world, including Africa. But the typical African women still has
5 children over her lifetime; a number that far exceeds that in every other
region of the world. Families with many children do not have the resources to
invest much in the education, health, and other human capital of their
children. As a result, for example, the World Economic Forum’s index ranks South Africa
at the very bottom in both math and science education out of over 100 countries
considered. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, high birthrates eat up economic progress and limit
the magnitude of increases in per capita incomes. However, if African economies
continue to grow at a high rate, parents will begin to reduce rapidly the
number of children they have in order to invest more human capital in each
child, as has happened in every other country that experienced sustained
economic progress.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most African countries have enormous health problems due to
the heavy incidence of malaria, Aids, and other diseases. For example, life
expectancy in South Africa declined from 65 years at 1990 to just about 50
years as the prevalence of Aids among 15-49 year olds grew to about 20%. Yet
great progress is possible in improving health in this region. Foreign
assistance can be important in the health field through the provision of
medicines, knowledge, and medical personnel,as long as the aid mainly goes to
NGOs and other private African organizations rather than through
corrupt governments.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Africa still gets too much foreign aid that raises
government spending at the expense of the private sector. Net official aid to
Africa has risen sharply since 1970 as shares of both government spending and
GDP. In 2008, such aid constituted more than 30% of government spending and 4%
of African GDP. India discovered during its first 40 years of independence that
foreign aid-India used to be the world’s largest recipient of foreign aid- only
slowed down the necessary adjustments toward a smaller government sector and a
larger competitive private sector. Africa needs to learn the same lesson.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clearly, for these and other reasons, economic progress in
Africa is not assured. Yet the evidence provides grounds for far greater
optimism about Africa’s future than at any time during the past 100 years.</p>
