<p>Online courses began around 1990 with the growth of more
widespread access to the Internet. They spread rapidly in the United States
during the last half of the 1990’s buoyed by the dot-com boom, and fell sharply
after that bubble burst. During this early period, online courses typically
charged fees. Some of the courses catered to individuals who wanted to improve
their job prospects, others were meant solely for intellectual enjoyment, while
some could be used to obtain college degrees. For-profit schools with physical
facilities, such as DeVry University and the University of Phoenix, were often
sponsors of online courses, although a few of these courses were sponsored by
nonprofit universities.</p>
<p>What is new about the MOOCs (which stands for “massive open
online courses”) is not the use of the Internet to instruct in particular
subjects, but that they are free, and they often are sponsored by some of the
very best universities, such as MIT, Harvard, and Stanford. Since they cost
little if anything to take, it is much easier for the MOOCs to get massive
enrollments than the fee-charging courses offered during the earlier boom in
online courses. Various recent articles on MOOCs in the New York Times by Tamar
Lewin show that the massiveness of the enrollments is somewhat misleading
since, as one would expect with free courses, the great majority of those
initially enrolled fail to finish. Still, the number of persons who do finish
these courses is very large compared even to what are considered very big
enrollments in on-site courses. </p>
<p>Aside from typically being free, the other unique aspect of
MOOCs is that many of them are sponsored by known, often well-known, private
and public universities. Since so far these universities get no revenue from
the MOOCs they offer, the motivation is teaching to much larger audiences,
favorable publicity for the universities involved, and the prospect of
eventually earning revenue from these courses by charging fees or in other
ways. The cost of offering these courses is typically not large since even the
super star professors who sometimes lecture in online courses are quite cheap,
and they may even do it without receiving any payment since they too want to
spread knowledge and their influence.</p>
<p>Particularly given my long time interest in human capital, I
have been excited by the prospects of online education since the 1990s. Indeed,
I was a little involved at that time in helping to develop a for-profit company
that offered fee-charging courses to men and women who wanted to improve their
skills so that they could get better employment opportunities. Online courses
have many advantages: they can enroll large numbers of students from many
countries and of various ages, individuals can take them at their convenience
from their homes and when they have free time, online students can easily
communicate with each other even when they are located in different countries,
and enrollees can get quick feedback from their answers to quizzes and other
questions posed by instructors.</p>
<p>The equally obvious downside of online courses is that they
do not involve direct personal contact with online instructors and classmates.
No one yet really knows how important such direct contact is to the learning
process. It likely varies from student to student, and depends also on the
materials covered, and how the instructor conveys what he or she knows. I do
not expect online course programs to compete effectively in the next decade
against the education offered by top universities, although that may be because
I do not appreciate fully how comfortable young people are with online
communication. Still, I do expect online instruction to become very good
substitutes for the thousands of courses offered by lesser schools.</p>
<p>Since online courses are so convenient and
will remain relatively cheap, I expect them to spread rather rapidly sometimes even
when they are decidedly inferior to courses that allow personal contact with
instructors and fellow students. Online courses are likely to be particularly
popular in developing countries because the worldwide boom in higher education
during the past several decades has meant that many developing countries are
trying to rapidly boost enrollments in higher education. A good example of what
might happen in higher education in these countries is provided by the
installation of cell phone towers in many poorer parts of the world, such as
rural India and most parts of Africa. Poor families in these areas are now able
to use cell phones to communicate with the outside world without their
governments or private companies having to lay expensive phone cables for wired
phone service. </p>
<p>Similarly, building physical facilities to accommodate very
large numbers of new enrollees in higher education would be quite expensive for
developing countries. When access to the Internet becomes widely available in
developing countries-it already is in China- online courses that qualify for
credits toward a college degree would be a substitute for physical facilities.
These degrees typically would not be of the quality offered say by Peking
University in China or the IITs in India, but a system of higher education
should have a diverse mixture of schools with different approaches to teaching
and offering various qualities of education.</p>
<p> In summary, I
expect online education to be a rapidly growing part of the higher education
landscape, especially in developing countries that want to expand quickly higher
education opportunities.</p>
