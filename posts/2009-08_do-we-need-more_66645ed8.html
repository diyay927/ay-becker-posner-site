<h3>Do We Need More Regulation of Mortgages to Protect Consumers?--Posner</h3>
<p>The Treasury Department in its "white paper" of June 17 recommended the creation of a "Consumer Financial Protection Agency," and later followed up with a detailed legislative proposal for a "Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act of 2009." The proposal is pending in Congress.</p>
<p>Although the Commission's remit would not be limited to mortgages, risky mortgage lending is the Act's principal target. The supporters of the Act maintain that quite apart from instances of fraud, which are punishable under existing law, many consumers were unable to deal sensibly with the terms of the mortgages that were offered to them during the housing boom of the early 2000s, which peaked in March 2006 and then deflated, bringing down much of the rest of the economy with it, as we know. The mortgage bankers and other sellers of residential mortgages often did not require that prospective buyers demonstrate that they had the financial wherewithal to be able to repay the mortgages; mortgages that required no down payment were sold, often to people of quite limited financial means; prepayment penalties were common, which make it costly to refinance a mortgage if interest rates fall; and many mortgages were "ARMs"--adjustable-rate mortgages, which specified low "teaser" rates for the first few years followed by higher rates when at the end of the teaser period the rates were "reset."</p>
<p>A recent, and very thorough, article, by Oren Bar-Gill, "The Law, Economics and Psychology of Subprime Mortgage Contracts," 94 <em>Cornell Law Review </em>1073 (2009), argues that many consumers made themselves worse off by taking out mortgages during the boom (in fact the bubble) period because they could not respond rationally to the offers by the sellers of mortgages. Many of them could not compare the terms of alternative mortgages (say a conventional 30-year mortgage and an ARM) because the terms were not stated in an intelligible fashion. In addition many consumers were afflicted by "myopia" and "optimism." "Myopia" in this context means inability to give proper weight to future costs--for example, higher interest rates when the mortgage resets; they do not look behind the "teaser" rates even though the reset rates are disclosed. "Optimism" in this context refers to exaggerating one's future economic prospects--unrealistically believing that either one's income will increase or housing prices will continue rising and by doing so enable one to refinance the mortgage on attractive terms--one's equity will have increased because the amount of the mortgage is fixed.</p>
<p>Bar-Gill's concern with inadequate disclosure of the annual percentage interest rate of mortgages does not present a novel regulatory issue. The Truth in Lending Act requires disclosure of the annual percentage interest rate of a mortgage or other consumer loan (APR), and if the requirements are inadequate (Bar-Gill believes that the APR is not required to be disclosed early enough in the negotiations over the mortgage), or violations not punished severely enough to deter, the Act can be amended. But neither the Truth in Lending Act nor any other statute or regulation, so far as I know, requires that mortgage offers be designed to discourage choices based on myopia or optimism. Bar-Gill himself recommends only requiring earlier and clearer disclosure of APR, though he describes this as a first step in purging the mortgage market of irrationality, rather than a complete solution to the problems he sees.</p>
<p>His analysis is based, as he explains, on findings by behavioral economists, who investigate departures from rationality in economic decision making. But like them, he does not make clear what he means by "rationality." It cannot mean full information, or the ability to process information flawlessly, because these condtions are rarely met in any area of human activity. It does, however, imply consistency and the avoidance of fallacies that cause serious harm, financial or otherwise, to people who harbor them.</p>
<p>It is unclear that either myopia or optimism in the sense in which Bar-Gill uses these terms is irrational. It might seem that if the discounted annualized present cost of an ARM is higher than that of a fixed-rate mortgage, anyone who prefers the former is irrational: he is paying more than he has to. But that conclusion depends critically on the discount rate, which differs from person to person. Some people have very low discount rates; they save a lot of money, or they incur substantial costs in an education that will yield a commensurate increase in earnings only after many years. Other people have high discount rates; they live for the present. These people are not irrational. The difference between them and people with low discount rates is a matter of personality rather than of cognition.</p>
<p>If you have a high discount rate, the low teaser rate in an adjustable-rate mortgage may be a good deal more attractive than the high reset rates. You are "irrational" only from the perspective of low-discount-rate persons, such as Professor Bar-Gill, who has two doctorates, two masters degrees, and a total of 13 years of education after high school. </p>
<p>Optimism is also a personality trait, and, as it happens, one essential to human progress. As I have argued elsewhere with reference to our current economic situation, what Keynes called "animal spirits" and, alternatively, confidence or optimism are essential to entrepreneurship because of the great uncertainty of a business environment. Someone who invests in building a factory that will not produce anything for years is taking a big risk of failure, and because it is a risk that cannot be reliably quantified he is taking a leap of faith, and he will not do that unless he happens to have an optimistic outlook. It is not that rationality implies such an outlook, but that rationality is not inconsistent with it. Optimists are often disappointed, but sometimes are richly rewarded for the risks they take; and as long as the prospect for such rewards confers on them greater ex ante utility than more cautious, pessimistic decisions would do, they are not behaving irrationally. "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" is the credo of the optimist and the terror of the pessimist, but neither reaction is irrational. The optimist and the pessimist just have different personalities. Bar-Gill has made a value judgment rather than an economic judgment.</p>
<p>Now it is possible that the kind of wet-blanket regulation that he might favor if he thought it feasible--which is the kind of regulation that the sponsors of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act very much do favor--could be defended on macroeconomic grounds, as conducing to economic stability. Had there not been in the early 2000s a strong market for risky mortgages, there would have been fewer defaults when the housing bubble burst and therefore less damage to the solvency of the banking industry. But whether the proposed Act would do anything to limit risky mortgage lending is unclear. It would authorize the Consumer Financial Protection Agency to require that a prospective mortgagor be shown, and entitled to choose, a "plain vanilla" mortgage that would be very short and easy to read and would alert the mortgagor to the various risks created by different mortgage terms. But if people have high discount rates and (or) are highly optimistic, disclosure of alternatives will not affect their choice.</p>
<p>So the stability issue narrows to how many mortgagors there are who, if only the alternatives to a risky mortgage were presented clearly to them, would forgo the risky option. Doubtless there are some; Bar-Gill cites persuasive evidence of that. But enough to prevent another housing bubble? That seems unlikely, but is in any event unproven.<br/>

<p>Judge Posner: I definitely agree with your article, but wonder about a different angle on the discussion: what about the role of education? Have we really addressed the profound consequences of loading students up with general education for four years in high school (English for four years, geography, US history, world history, biology, chemistry, physics, etc.) and not teaching about interest rates, inflation, trade, taxes, contracts, statutes, and entitlements? Don't they deserve that? Haven't the opportunity costs now risen to trillions of dollars?</p>

<p>1. The issue of fraud, or con criminals, will never be resolved by better disclosure.  Cognitive dissonance will kick in before reason.</p>
<p>2. Again, the role of the regulator is not to prevent the risk of fraud, especially when they don't have a good sociological model of it.</p>
<p>Erving Goffman provided the correct analysis of what regulators are really up to many years ago, http://www.tau.ac.il/~algazi/mat/Goffman--Cooling.htm</p>
<p>Goffman is correct, but it is a truth which cannot be stated by the regulator.</p>
<p>3.  Finally, it is unlikely that our current economic crisis is due to a myopic borrowers.  There simply are not enough of them, no matter how you count them.</p>

<p>So, we're calling "stupidity" optimism these days?  I know that many home-buyers were terribly short-sighted in agreeing to some of the loans that they have now defaulted on, but the language posed makes it seem like they shouldn't bear any responsibility for their poor choices.  The government cannot regulate intelligence anymore than it can regulate human ignorance.</p>

<p>Are there any proposals for reining in the myopia and over-optimism of the regulators? If the low-income people who made the "obviously" foolish assumption that home prices would continue to increase had asked, say, Barney Frank for advice prior to signing, wouldn't he have told them to "roll the dice?"</p>

<p>The regulators were responsible in large part for the bubble in the first place. They made it essentially risk free for the consumer and risk intense for the lenders. The consumers understood only too well that a no money down, sub-prime loan was easy to default and walk away, not to mention the second home market in California, Arizona and Florida. Ignorance indeed. Try greed and envy and try regulating that.</p>

<p>Regulation via exposition? That would be nice.</p>
<p> Some of these Mortgage Contracts are so complicated and confused that it requires at least a Masters in Finance and JD in Real Estate and Contract Law (and I'm not so sure about these guys and gals understanding them). And everyone wants the average Joe and Josephine too take full responsibility and understand all the nuances by themselves? Goodluck! Change and regulation is needed. Even the Fraudsters are having problems recognizing the fraudlent.    </p>

<p>It's been reported by several news outlets that as many as 1.5 million home mortgage loans 90 days or more delinquent can't be foreclosed and the collateral liquidated because the secured promissory notes were sliced, diced, securitized, repackaged into bonds, and sold to investors in a manner so botched that the servicers and state court judges can't determine who "owns and holds" the evidence of indebtedness.  The number is sure to grow as waves of now-upside down home loans funded at the '06-'07 peak fall into default.  We saw a little of this "bad-chain-of-transfer" stuff during the S&amp;L bailout era, but it was trifling compared to the fiasco Wall St's securitization schemes will have yielded.  All real estate in America is "local" - i.e., land titles, the stuff of state law.  If state court judges across the country start holding the loan servicers, indenture trustees, and lender agents to the strict letter of local law when foreclosure is applied for or opposed, the only "solution" left will be for Congress to pass legislation to buy up and, effectively, bail out all the garbled-ownership home mortgage debt securities by a process tantamount to a bulk in rem condemnation.  (After all, we're going to have to do it with Fannie &amp; Freddie anyway, right?)  Eminent domain leaves no title defect uncured.  Nobody can pass a stronger title upon resale than the sovereign.</p>
<p>A lot of land title and real estate financing law has been made in my state, Texas.  It was driven by agriculture and petrochemicals.  The Big Oil companies were once upon a time fierce marketplace competitors (remember the '50's-'60's gasoline price wars?), but they were of one mind when it came to real estate acquisition or financing: you never put your $$$ behind anything that you don't control.  The term "land banking" wasn't coined by accident.  But Wall St, aided &amp; abetted by the bond rating quants and the credit sweetener (derivatives) market, blew right past it.  They can't be trusted to securitize home loan finance.  If Congress is going to "reform"  anything, it ought to begin with home mortgage loan securitization.  Just outlaw it, get it off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Brian's comment seems spot-on.</p>
<p>It seems that not enough people are paying attention to the principal agent problem. If a lending agent knows that the loan is going to be chopped up and sold immediately after making the loan, the lender has less incentive to avoid lending to people where the terms increase likelihood of default. The securitization of mortgages seemed to have played a huge role in the formation of the housing bubble.</p>

<p>One solution would be the institution of standardized mortgage contracts in fixed increments, (say, in increments of $20,000), traded in open exchange marketsâlike we do with other securities.  The underwriting process would be standardized, and the interest rates would float on the open markets.  The only black box would be the underwriting, credit verification and appraisal components.  However, the presence of an exchange mechanism would serve to advance standards and verification procedures in these areas as well.  </p>
<p>The underwriting could be rationalized by separating its component processes into parts that can themselves be rationalized, adding to the quality of contextual epistemological granularity.  The credit reporting agencies would provide the risk handicap (credit scores), and; Regional Sales Records would provide âmarket values,â with the dispersion measurements of same serving to handicap the risk for individual properties.  Furthermore, demographic information provided by municipalities and verified by bond rating type agencies would provide a handicap on the likelihood that specific properties would continue to be kept up.  The best part is that many of the valuation components that were formerly black box and subject to individual judgment would be brought to light and counted openly.</p>
<p>The reason this would work is that all the cards would be on the table, and so market players can be evaluated based on rational factors, which themselves can be seen in their contextâwhich is the only way we can judge anything.</p>

<p>I believe Thaler (and perhaps Sunstein) have written about this elsewhere, but it's absolutely true that if you refuse to concede that those people whom you label "pessimists" are, on average, objectively better off than those whom you label "optimists," then behavioral economics has nothing to say.  That is because you are assuming away the problem behavioral economics has identified, and which Thaler, Sunstein and others attempt to address.</p>
<p>Behavioral economic-inspired reforms are about sorting.  Of course it's true that some people are optimists and that society benefits with some measure of optimists.  But it's also true that many people who are (for example) attracted to teaser mortgage rates are suffering from cognitive failings.  Behavioral economists assume by definition that the latter group of people would make different choices if they were presented with the same information in a different way.  They are being influenced by presentation, not substance.  Thus, behavioralists hope to prompt people at least to consider alternatives by presenting the same information in a different manner.</p>
<p>One common way of doing this is by explaining alternatives.  Behavioralists hold that people respond differently depending on whether a choice is framed negatively or positively.  Thus, if a person is told that a certain course of treatment gives them a 2% chance of living, they may make quite different choices than if they are told that the same course of treatment gives them a 98% chance of dying.  The example seems artificial, but analogs play out in the real world with great frequency.</p>
<p>Mortgages are an obvious case.  It is surely wrong to suppose (as you seem to be doing) that all or even most people who choose teaser mortgages have actually considered whether they would be better off with a different mortgage, or without any mortgage at all.  The behavioralist response is simply to reframe the presentation of the relevant information.</p>

<p>In answer to the behaviorist school dude that posted at 11:16am on 9-1-2009, I believe that it is not a matter of explaining the terms better, nor is it a matter of people âfreely choosing âbadâ mortgages.â  Itâs sort of like Newton with âgravity:â He couldnât define it, but he knew it acted a certain way, (in accord with the âinverse square lawâ).  The same is true of economics and Cartesian style analysis in general.  We donât necessarily know the essence of the âwhatâ of xâs and yâs are, but we can get a better handle on whatâs going on from casting light on their relationships to each other.  </p>
<p>The failure of the behaviorist approach is that it emphasizes the need for a normative âfreedom of marketsâ in terms of a âfreedom of information.â  But information itself is a marketable thing.  Information is not free until it is rendered so by being widely available.  Market forces influence its evolution and dissemination.  It would be wrong and foolish to suppose that others can be, (let alone should be), forced somehow to either enlighten us about the traps they themselves have set for us, or about the traps that third parties may set for us.  That said, we need to continue to enforce social strictures against fraudulent acts when they are discovered.  But responsibility for our education lies ultimately with us as individuals.  The only education is self education.  </p>
<p>Those who walk into these financial traps need to wise up about their assumptions as to the desirability or permanency of âsocial safety netsââand those that set these financial snares need to wise up to the consequences to the social fabric that they create through their laying of traps for their fellow human beings.  No one is immune from personal responsibility, and no one is immune from the need to walk wisely.  God may not be watching, (I donât know and neither do you), but both forms of stupidity (playing the Innocent Baby and playing the Rapacious Vulture) are most assuredly punished sooner or later by nature itself.</p>

<p>if indeed the "regulators who made it risk free for osnumers..." who are repsonsible, then you must mean Mr Greenspan who flooded the markets with cheap credit with his low interest rates....as to the risk intense lenders, surely you jest. after originating the loans, they quickly sold them off as securities whcih were then repeatedly repackaged and sold over and again (to the last fool standing) on the false premise that credit risk ahd been removed in the process.</p>

<p>To say that something is more than âmerely black and white,â begs the question of attempting to offer some solution.  It is true that one can abuse Occamâs razor and so make problems worse.  But, letâs face it:  Arthur Leff was an oversimplifying Nihilist.  I agree that we canât get permanent normative principles from ethical modeling.  But we can design systems that enhance the quality of life, as Locke and Montesquieu did with their notions of checks and balances on power and abuses.  We donât have to buy into the Leffian argument that âitâs all too complicated.â  Yes, right and wrong are an over-simplification if imposed by a Hobbesian authorityâbut we to need to build models and refine a process to see what can be normatively applied.  We do need to examine things.  After all, knowledge consists in what remains after we prove that what is wrong is wrong.</p>

<p>Think of Granularity as pixels per square inch of understanding.  When you zoom into something you claim to understand understand, the more pixels you have at that deeper level, the clearer the picture remains at the deeper level--thus, the finer the grain.  Also, the more pixels you have, the more it tends to relate to the bigger picture.  But this only works if the two views hold context, i.e., can be reconciled without contradiction.  So, if your are looking at a conglomerate's books, (Zoomed out), or a divisions books, (Zoomed in), you should be able to presume certain relationships between the two views.  To the degree this is true, you have increased granularity of viewpoint. </p>
<p>Epistemology refers to the grounds of knowledge and touches on everything that has to to with what can be known as such.  So, when I refer to Epistemological Granularity, I am speaking of a quest for a broad understanding of matters in both a larger and smaller context in a manner that can be known.  </p>

<p>John, I am familiar with "Epistemology" I do have some training in Philosophy. My problem comes when it is coupled with "Granularity". The problem comes when a computer style model and analog is used to explain the human mind and it's ability to explain understanding. </p>
<p>Let's turn to Logic and the principles of Cognition, Corroboration, and Verification. The issue becomes what set of "books" are we looking at? The ones set up for Public viewing or the ones kept in the depths of the Organization behind that legendary "Veil". Depending on which ones are being viewed, It will affect not only the size of the "pixels" but their "color" as well. Thus changing the whole picture and its understanding or lack of.</p>
<p>The solution? Simplicity and Clarity. Maybe then, Joe and Josephine may be able to understand what they're getting into.</p>
<p>A fundamental rule of Grammar and Syntax:<br/>
Single syllable signs tend to clarity and understanding. Poly-syllables, to complexity and confusion. Especially, when the signs and symbols are not explained or defined adequately. Then even the "experts" become confused and befuddled.      </p>

<p>I am so glad that you are so intelligent, capable, dynamic, and forceful that you have no need what so ever of any type of advice, professional or otherwise or economic/legal protection either. Such as, "Truth in Lending", "Consumer Financial Protection", assorted property protection rights, etc., etc. Unlike the approx. 280 million other Americans.  </p>
<p>Ever heard of a "pig in a poke" "ponzi schemes", "cooking the books", Bernie Madoff, Enron, Worldcom, subprime mortgages, etc., etc., etc.? Ah..., the joys of Anarchy and unrestrained "Free" Enterprise.    </p>

<p>In response to the post of September 2, 2009 1:19 PM:</p>
<p>Yes, simplicity and clarity âshould beâ the order of the day.  I couldnât agree more with your normative assessment that we should all just do the right thing and get along.  But that isnât natureâand so, it isnât possible, except where it can be shown to be in the interests of someone who can freely opt to do otherwise.  The result of this pervasive lack of clarity is that every one of us is rendered an unfair exploiter of the weak.  No one of us behaves, or could rationally be expected to behave as if âGod was watching.â  That may be a harsh assessment of our human condition.  But it is reality.  We withhold information and resources from each other with the intention of using the advantages gained by so doing.</p>
<p>When you eat a chicken sandwich, a chicken is made to suffer and die through no fault of its own, (as if âfaultâ mattered).  That chicken sandwich is processed by a number of people that, (it could be argued) do not make a âliving wage.â  (They do not make that living wage because they lack the information and the resources to obtain those skills.  Hell, they often donât even know of the importance of obtaining better skills or which skills to obtain.)  If you donât eat the chicken sandwich, you have exploited these workers even more by having deprived them of a jobâat least that part of a job required to fill your gut.</p>
<p>So, how do we morally deal with this cannibalâs banquet?  We must take personal responsibility to see to it that the world becomes a better place: first for ourselves as individuals, lest we lose the advantage necessary to assert our choice, and then; for our fellow beings (people, animals, nature, etc.).  But we must never lose sight of the martial nature of nature--and in our helping others, we must never allow them to be lulled into a false sense of serenity and security, lest we leave them worse off than before we attempted to âhelp.â  </p>
<p>As we live by principle, we need to be aware of our context.  We need to look at the whole picture.  Yes, sometimes we reel from what we see.  But we must see it and reconcile itânot recoil from it and embrace the fairy tales of normative utopias and the brotherhood of man.  People who offer such utopias are usually exploiters of a much more thorough sort.  Such people are what we call despots.</p>
<p>The fact of exploitation--even its necessity--should be an acknowledged reality.  Nevertheless, we should mitigate it through an agreed system of checks and balancesâwhich include the "clarity" you speak of.  But as I said before, such systems need to be put in place by, and for, people to whom it can be shown that it is in their interests to do soâand who are still free to opt to do otherwise.  After all, we are all choosersâand we must all be able consent, or not consent, or withdraw our consentâor we will find ways to evade.  After all "compliance works only when it is in harmony with the will. </p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, you don't have to be a genius to know that in ordinary times of low to moderate inflation, the best long term ROI for individuals is aboutb 8 to 10%. The 20% Madoff and his minions were promising was not possible and should not have been believed by a normally intelligent and non-greedy person. I can hear it now at the country club or the cocktail party; "I got a guy who can make you 20%". Right. So I need the government to protect me not only from Madoff's greed and  but also from my own.

<p>Compliance is the key.  Without compliance, you get cheaters and evaders.  People must be willing to comply with normative âprinciplesâ if they are to work.  Thus, the principles themselves must be attractive enough to inspire compliance.  Anything short of this encourages defection.  Anything short of this fails to bring about lasting change.  If we have not figured out the principles of a good society that also inspires willing and private compliance, we have not truly figured out the principles of a good society: We have only mixed up a new pitcher of Cool-aide for some despot to impose upon us âfor our own good.â  </p>
<p>If we fail to honor anotherâs (any otherâs) individual will, we sow the seeds of inevitable social breakdown.  That is a fact.  It is a fact whether we violate the rich by taxing them more than the poor, or if we violate the poor by stunting their aspirations.  Life cannot be successfully opposed.</p>
<p>If we dumb people down enough to silence them, we can fool ourselves into thinking we have their compliance--But we donât.  Most of the thinking minds of this planet are on strike as their wills have been overridden by arrogant asses that fancy themselves âdeciders.â  Little do âthe decidersâ know how little about even their own lives they actually decide.  They may appear to decide much, but unless they actually posses the virtues of wisdom and knowledge, their deciding will be channeled by anything from unexamined cultural norms and prejudices to manipulative sycophants.  No one escapes the rules of nature, and decadence does eventually take its toll.  That is why the nation is in trouble today--we have reached a critical mass (proportion) of trust fund babies that is running things into the ground.</p>
<p>Just landing in a certain place in life does not confer virtue.  It may grant the fruits of virtueâbut it does not confer virtue.  Sure itâs good to be richâbut itâs better to know whatâs actually going onâonly then is the world yours.â</p>
<p>Anarchy is not the wayâitâs an unreasonable extreme.  Coercive law based on shortsighted normative principles is not the wayâit too is an unreasonable extreme.  I think it was Aristotle that proposed the idea of moderation in all things.  He was a wise dude.  So were Montesquieu and Locke, who both went a long way in explaining what good societies were all about far better than I can.</p>

<p>Amen to John. WE know from history what works and what doesn't but like children we have to learn the hard way. A moral society is one based on conscience and the absence of the seven vices and the presence of the seven virtues. We need leaders who advance that concept not the political hacks we have now and not academic ethicists who cmpete to develop a universal theory of ethics and justice of which there is none.</p>

<p>Ah yes ..., the "Categorical Imperative" at work. I wish I could view the World through such Rose tinted glases. Unfortunately, Experience and the reality of life and the World is such that there are those who if not beaten down with a large stick will only be at the throats of all others. That's why there are such institutions as the CIA, FBI, Armed Forces, the Police, Justice Dep't. and all the Courts both Civil and Criminal at the Federal, State and Local levels along with the Prisons. Not too mention the Churches and Synagogues. </p>

<p>Bah.</p>
<p>I have to disagree with Posner here.</p>
<p>Just because you say it is merely a difference in personality, does not mean it is merely a difference in personality. In particular, we SHOULD judge irresponsibility to be, well, irresponsible.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of optimism. But, optimism must be rationally tempered with realism. If it is not, then it is no longer merely a personality difference but rather a character flaw. A very common one. (Pyramid schemes would be doomed if a subset of the population was not susceptible to this character flaw.)</p>
<p>Unless one is unusually lucky in a way that the typical person will not be and cannot rationally and realistically expect to be, one cannot expect to have good outcomes in the future without planning and a realistic outlook regarding the future.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are certainly rational differences in discount rates between current and future consumption. But neither extreme is rational. If all one does is work (and they do not enjoy their work, like Posner enjoys his) for the future without any enjoyment of the present and they continue like this throughout a lifetime or most of a lifetime, that does not make sense. The advice to "stop and smell the flowers" can actually make people better off. </p>
<p>Similarly, someone who is not thinking of the future at all (all the are thinking about is where they are going to get their next hit of their favorite illegal drug) is not behaving rationally either. These people will not only find themselves in a very uncomfortable position in the distant future, they will find themselves in that situation in the near future. Not only will their future not be as pleasant, it will probably actually be very unpleasant and full of suffering.</p>
<p>Combine these flaws and you have a recipe for disaster. Someone who focuses excessively on present pleasure and who is irrationally optimistic about the future. That person is what is rightly called irresponsible. Hopefully, the damage they do to others in their madness is limited, but experience suggest that in most cases such people will do harm to those around them in some way with their irresponsible behavior.</p>
<p>So, what has Posner established? He has established that optimism is not a bad thing, in fact it is usually a good thing. He has established that differences in discount rates should be respected. He has established that we should not take our own personality, and insist that others fall on the same place on the pessimist-optimist scale and have the same discount rate. I agree with these points.</p>
<p>A lot of things are like this. If someone is sad, you probably should just let them be sad. It is normal and healthy to be sad sometimes. But if this goes on and on and is very intense, then it is not mere sadness, but depression.</p>
<p>I think that Posner's argument, if we were to transport it into this context, would go something like this. Because sadness is not a strange thing and not something we should normally interfere with, depression is not a problem either. </p>
<p>And that is where he is wrong.</p>
<p>Just because optimism is a good thing, that does not mean that a total lack of realism in financial affairs is a good thing. This is not just a personality preference - that tendency is dangerous - and it has large negative externalities.</p>
<p>Just because it is reasonable to have a lower discount rate between present and future consumption, that does not mean that it is reasonable to put too much focus on current consumption. There is a reasonable range, and then there are extremes which are problematic.</p>
<p>Anyway, it is perfectly fair to say that people with discount rates that are too low or too high are irrational. It is perfectly fair to say that people whose optimism in financial affairs exceed all bounds of what is even close to reasonably likely are irrational.</p>
<p>I should point out that "unrealistic" optimism should be viewed differently in different contexts. Consumers of mortgages are not innovators in their consumption. Their unrealistic optimism is not likely to have positive externalities. In contrast, the "unrealistic" optimism of the Wright Brothers had huge positive externalities.</p>
<p>We should not generally curtail optimism, even unreasonable optimism, where technological innovation could result. Especially since there is a huge risk that what we view as "unreasonable" optimism could be due to our own lack of insight. But, it makes complete sense to curtail unreasonable optimism by consumers in the financial sector.</p>
<p>A final point. A large part of the regulation here is not about optimism or discount rates. It is about people not really fully comprehending what they are getting themselves into. We are not talking about "perfect information" here. We are talking about having a reasonable enough understanding of consequences to evaluate the wisdom of action or inaction. Mortgages and financial documents are complex. This understanding is often lacking.</p>

<p>In response to the comment made on Sept. 3, 2009 @ 3:22 pm, and more broadly proponents of additionally regulating disclosure:</p>
<p>Had such legislation been passed in 2006 or earlier would the supporters of this action be more at ease with the current state of the economy? Granted, I realize that my question is loaded and assumes that even with additional disclosure agents would have made the same decision. However, I see it difficult to rationalize that such individuals would choose anything different in light of the actions those more educated in finance. For example, once these mortgages were divided up and put up for sale on the market were not experienced brokers and other experts on the market part of the group buying up these sub-prime mortgages? Some may contend that these individuals were acting rational with self interest in mind. Yet is not the assumption, and hope, of this bill that with a clearer understanding of the risks the individual would choose what this blog classifies as a "pessimistic" option? Clearly even those who are experts in the field do not choose pessimism in every instance, even when understanding more fully the risks in the marketplace. </p>
<p>Therefore, it appears this bill hopes to establish a bizarre double standard. One in which we expect what proponents refer to as the financially ignorant and ill-equip to make a more "rational" decision after a few moments of counseling with a loan officer than a well read professional. At the heart of this bill seems not to be a matter of presenting information in a positive way, but rather imposing a specific normative view on what this forum has concluded to be a financially unaware person's personal decision. As the person who posted at 3:22 put it such people are not "sad" but "depressed". That being the case it seems unlikely that presenting the facts more clearly would sway someone with such a chronic economic illiteracy, as that post assumes such people have, to choose any different. If these people do lack the ability to make a rational decision on their own then it would be only by persuasion that they would reach a rational decision. Thus, the assumptions about people who defaulted defeat the need to disclose information any plainer. And any legislation that sets a president of regulating the thought and decision making abilities of someone who is merely uninformed is unethical.  </p>
<p>At the root of this problem though seems not to be whether or not a person can rationally pick between an adjustable rate or fixed rate mortgage, but whether or not a bank can rationally decide if a person should be approved for a mortgage. So if anything is to be regulated in this debate sub prime lending seems to be a logical choice. However, for the moment it would appear the banks have learned their lesson.               </p>

<p>Glass Steagall, while clumsy, stood for something important.  The need for the separation between commercial and investment banking, that is, between debt and equityâmore importantly, between bankers' ethics and traders' ethics.  Every real banker and loan origination clerk on the ground saw the quality of lending dropping into the toilet.  Securities trading can't be allowed to vertically subsidize and thus industrialize a manufactory of debt like so many hamburgers.  Those selling repackaged debt didn't care to see, much less warn, that the quality of this brand-new, so-called debt was now equivalent to Bernie Madoff-ville.  Those who saw it unfolding announced the impending disaster and traded against crash for years, which is why $62 trillion in credit default bets got sold prior to autumn 2008, a market clue, or bullhorn, readable by any idiot. Yet the unsophisticated continued to be herded into taking on far more debt ("just refinance tomorrow!!") than was wise for them. The question is simply, what responsibility does a decent society owe to the unsophisticated?  Just a little, perhaps?  Everyone in the know knew that "diversification" by slicing and dicing had strict limits beyond which lay ruin.  They just weren't saying, whilst their money picking party was on.  And therein's the rub.  It's not about economics, stupid.  It is about law, meaning, basic common decency and ethics.</p>

<p>I am sorry but I just don't get it. I can wax eloquently in high sounding language, but in the end we are talking about borrowing money. The housing bubble did not burst because of the arcane details of subparagraph b or paragraph 27, page 3 of the 3rd codicil or the mortgage documents.<br/>
This resulted either from a failure to understand very basic aspects of borrowing - that you will owe interest, that you have to pay back what you borrowed, or from the possibly wise financial decision to walking away. Short term changes in the value of the home are meaningless - unless you are speculating. <br/>
The biggest flaw I see is that restricting lenders ability to filter risky borrows caused the entire industry to try to find ways to avoid being caught holding the old maid. The ways in which the mortgage industry changed are reflections of each facets efforts to pass the risk on to somebody else.</p>

<p>You may have hit the nail on the head, "... are we so arrogant that we believe that no one before us knew anything"? This current Economic Crisis has been developing since the Reagan years (remember "Voodoo Econ.). This all started with the Deregualtion mania under Reagan and accelerated throughout subsequent Administrations. In essence, wiping out and destroying the Financial and Investment Regulatory Environment that was developed and instituted during and after the Great Depression -in response to these self-same similiar problems.</p>
<p>As someone once commented when the "Deregulation" Mania took hold in the 80's, "Well ..., looks like we're about to rediscover the reasons why these Economic/Financial Regulations were passed and placed into operation/Law in the first place." Talk about a prophetic vision and statement.     </p>

<p>Regulations or No Regulations.  That is NOT the question.  The question is: what is the proper attitude for the individual to take?  </p>
<p>The proper attitude he should take is one of a bias for his private individuality--his identity.  Identity distinguishes men from one another.  Identity is the thing in itself as distinguished from other things.  Individuals who make choices can maintain their identity only so long as they those things in the environment that support him and shun those that don't.  This is the beginning of an understanding of how to approach the regulation question.  </p>
<p>Some regulations support personal choices and some do not.  Some laws acknowledge individual judgment, and grant room for individual movement, and some do not.  Some social attitudes attribute the power and wisdom of choice to individuals and some do not.  When choosing among regulations, governments must always keep this individualist perspective foremost in mind.</p>
<p>The advantage of a "Public Option" in health care is that it introduces a wider flexibility to individuals to change jobs without risking deep financial loss.  Also, what we call "work" itself would be opened to a wider definition as the issue of medical insurance will have finally been laid to rest, as the weighting of market forces would cease to include the distortions of a bloated health care system.</p>
<p>What we have now affords far less financial protection than in the rest of the industrialized world.  It makes us third world dependent on the good graces of self styled "deciders" who, like their counterparts in mid-evil Europe, can dismiss anyone at will on a mere imperious whim, consigning them to a financial oblivion.  Further, as the government has already caused the shape and price of health care to become distorted beyond even the possibility of the reach of "market discipline," it behooves us to support a public option as an offset to this grossly unaccountable system.  At least with the government involved, we can at least a hope for a little more than the pretense of a true "market" that does not, and likely cannot exist, given the accumulated distortions created in the industry as it now stands.  </p>

<p>I'd like to echo sentiments above: We need to recover some lost wisdom from the not-so-distant past.  We need to do some WORK and start ACTUALLY READING the geniuses of the problems of economy and society.</p>
<p>True, it probably won't advance your career as an academic economist or financial analyst... only your understanding of real issues.</p>
<p>A 15-word caricature of a worldview does not suffice, whether it be of Neoliberalism or the German Historical School.</p>
<p>I personally advocate for a much broader canon. ["Read not to believe or disbelieve, but to weigh and consider."]  I strongly recommend against basing your economic worldview solely on Ayn Rand.</p>

<p>In response to "Galt, You may remember...(September 8, 2009 5:15 PM)"  </p>
<p>Before the 1870s there was a market health care system in some parts of the world, including parts of the US.  Then, "professionals" sought to protect their turf by limiting the the practice of medicine--not through market forces, nor certification among consenting peers--but by using government to outlaw everyone but themselves and their chosen treatment methods.  Now, midwives are scarce, medicine men no longer exist except in such remote locations as the highlands of Borneo, and the arts practiced by other traditional healers are all but lost.  The government has effectively leveled the playing field in favor of what has become a very narrowly defined, but over-reaching medical-industrial complex.  </p>
<p>The governments of the world have made the practice of medicine into a tight, and inaccessible and indivisible capital structure on a par with the military.  As the military can't be effectively divvied up and "privatized" for the benefit of the citizens of a nation--so too, the medical-industrial complex cannot be.  In its primitive (pre-1870s) state, it could have been left alone to develop along market lines.  But it has been so misshapen by a long history of government intervention that it has now effectively become an indivisible public good.  For an indivisible public good to be equitably accessible to all, it is necessary that it be mediated by the government.  </p>
<p>The honest question is how government should now be involved in health care--not whether it should be.</p>

<p>A cautionary tale on regulation.</p>
<p>In 1984 I bought a townhouse. I made the offer on the then standard, printed form used by RE brokers. It was one page long, legal-size.</p>
<p>In 1987 I bought a larger townhouse nearby. This time the offer was on a legally prescribed, densely printed form that took about five pages, each longer than legal size. This growth in volume was caused by the enactment of several laws designed to protect the consumer (purchaser). So did it prevent consumers from acting improvidently or foolishly? </p>
<p>I still don't understand what good it did, and I am certain that the vast majorityy of home buyers didn't understand all that dense legal prose and therefore didn't read it.</p>
