<p>The patent system as practiced in the United States is too
broad, too loose, and too expensive. As Posner shows, excessive trolling is an
excellent illustration of some of these weaknesses. Yet most of the largest
patent disputes, such as that between Apple and Motorola, do not involve trolls,
but rather expensive and time-consuming litigation between producing companies
in the same industry who differ over patent priority (although Google and other
producing companies collect patents too). Reforms of the system are needed that
greatly narrow the granting of patents in order to cut down such
costly and unproductive litigation.</p>
<p>Many individuals and small companies do not have enough
resources to either develop their inventions into products and services, or to
litigate against bigger companies that infringe their patents. As a result,
they might sell their patents to bigger companies that use them, or to
intermediaries that may in turn sell or license their patents. “Patent
assertion entities”, less flatteringly called  “patent trolls”, are intermediaries that sometimes litigate
against companies they claim infringed on the patents they bought. With a well
designed and functioning patent system, this type of intermediary would be
valuable in the patent market, as they are in the housing and stock markets.
The problem arises because a defective patent system creates opportunities for
hold ups and excessive litigation by these intermediaries and by others that
hold patents.</p>
<p>Major reforms to reduce these unproductive opportunities
would include lowering typical patent length and the scope of innovations that are
eligible for patents. The current patent length of 20 years (longer for drug
companies) from the date of filing for a patent can be cut in half without
greatly discouraging innovation. One obvious advantage of cutting patent length
in half is that the economic cost from the temporary monopoly power given to
patent holders would be made much more temporary. In addition, a shorter patent
length gives patent holders less of an effective head start in developing
follow on patents that can greatly extend the effective length of an original
patent. </p>
<p>Even pharmaceutical and biotech companies, the main examples
where patents are clearly necessary to encourage innovation, usually do not
need more than about a decade of monopoly power to encourage their very large
investments in new drugs. This is the case in many actual examples where after about
ten years molecularly similar drugs often are patented and compete against drugs
with the original patents.</p>
<p>Narrowing the type of innovations that can be patented is a
more challenging task than reducing patent length. The first step is to
recognize that many innovations presently cannot be patented.  A major example is the inability to
patent scientific theories and concepts, such as Einstein’s theory of
relativity, Darwin’s theory of evolution, or Keynes’ model of the macro
economy. The presumption in excluding basic scientific knowledge from the
patent system is that the cost of restricting open access to such discoveries far
exceeds any gains in encouraging the development of scientific concepts through
granting temporary monopolies to the creators. To offset the effect of this
exclusion from patent protection on the incentive to discover, individuals and
governments have created prizes and awards, like the Fields Medal and Nobel
Prizes, for mathematical and scientific discoveries.</p>
<p>In narrowing the type of innovations that are patentable, one
can start by eliminating the patenting of software. Disputes over software
patents are among the most common, expensive, and counterproductive. Their
exclusion from the patent system would discourage some software innovations,
but the saving from litigation costs over disputed patent rights would more
than compensate the economy for that cost. Moreover, some software innovations
would be encouraged because the inability to patent software will eliminate
uncertainty over whether someone else with a similar patent will sue and do
battle in the courts. </p>
<p>Instead of relying on the legal system, creators of new
software may then try to protect their innovations through secrecy. Even when
their secrets might be learned and sold by employees, companies that innovate
could gain because they then would pay less to employees in a position to
profit from learning about these innovations by selling the information to
competitors.</p>
<p>In addition to eliminating patents on software, no patents
should be allowed on DNA, such as identification of genes that appear to cause
particular diseases. Instead, they should be treated as other scientific
discoveries, and be in the public domain. The Supreme Court recently considered
a dispute over whether the genes that cause BRCA1 and BRCA2 deviations and
greatly raises the risk of breast cancer is patentable. Their ruling banned
patenting of human DNA, and this is an important step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Other categories of innovations should also be excluded from
the patent system. Essentially, patents should be considered a last resort, not
a first resort, to be used only when market-based methods of encouraging
innovations are likely to be insufficient, and when litigation costs will be manageable.
With such a “minimalist” patent system, patent intermediaries would have a
legitimate and possibly important role to play in helping innovators get and
protect their patent rights.</p>
