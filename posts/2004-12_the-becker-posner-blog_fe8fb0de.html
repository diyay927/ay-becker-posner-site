			Reply on Disease and Population-Becker
Some comments provide additional evidence that disease imposes a major burden on the living in poor nations of Africa and elsewhere. For example, disease interacts with nutrition, and poor nutrition causes diminished cognitive and physical capacities. The Malthusian model completely misses these harmful consequences of disease that far outweigh any beneficial effects a lower population might have on the incomes of the survivors.

I continue to be skeptical that population has been a major problem for India�s development. The last 15 years shows that with even reasonable economic reforms, per capita incomes can grow rapidly while population also does. In addition, it is well known that as nations develop economically, fertility before long begins to decline rapidly-that has already begun in India- as parents switch from having many ill-educated children to many fewer and much better educated children.

Africa and many other poor nations have a brain drain because ambitious and skilled individuals have limited opportunities in their own countries. As South Korea, Taiwan, China, and now India have shown, if a country begins to develop economically after introducing sensible policies and opportunities for the educated and entrepreneurially inclined, fewer skilled men and women leave, and many of the best begin to come back to start businesses and engage in other productive activities. Prior to the 1991 reforms, Indians were very successful business people and professionals in all countries but India!

One modern neo-Malthusian argument relates to global warming-the subject of an earlier discussion by Posner and me. A larger population may put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but it also provides a larger market for new technologies that help control the output of CO2 and other gases. In addition, a larger population also increases the number of potential inventors who might help solve warming and other challenges. So whatever one�s views on the importance of global warming, a larger population is more likely to help than hurt.
