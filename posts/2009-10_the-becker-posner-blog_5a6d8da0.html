			Longtime readers of this blog will be pleased to learn that this month sees its migration into book form. <em>Uncommon Sense: Economic Insights, from Marriage to Terrorism</em>, which collects what we believe are the best, most interesting, and most lasting posts from this blog. The posts selected for the book are representative of the wide range of topics we cover here, and, where appropriate, they've been updated to take account of subsequent events. 
  
The book is available at all good bookstores, on- and offline, as well as directly from the University of Chicago Press: http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=synopsis&amp;bookkey=1606474.
