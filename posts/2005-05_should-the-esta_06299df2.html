<h3>Should the Estate Tax Go? BECKER</h3>
<p>The tax cut law of 2001 included a slow phase out of the estate tax by 2010, but the tax is supposed to be reinstated in 2011 when the entire 2001 law expires. This strange political compromise on estate taxes presumably will not last, so it is a good time to consider what should be done about this tax. I believe taxes on estates should be permanently abolished since they do little to reduce income or wealth inequality, benefit a vast army of lawyers and accountants whose role is to find ways to cut taxes on the estates of the wealthy, create problems for some families with smaller businesses, and do not raise a lot of tax revenue. In April the House of Representatives rather strongly voted to repeal permanently the tax on estates, so the issue now goes to the Senate, where some Democrats are promising a filibuster.</p>
<p>In earlier times, bequests of assets, especially property, were the dominant way to pass economic wealth from parents to children. But after the knowledge revolution took off toward the end of the 19th century, bequests of financial and material wealth have become less important in the overall economy. Instead, the most important way for parents to bequeath economic position is through the transmission of knowledge in the form of education, training, and other human capital. Such capital embodied in people now comprises over 70 per cent of all wealth in economically advanced nations, far more important than material capital.</p>
<p>In modern economies children of better educated, higher earning, and more able parents on the average receive greater training and schooling, better health, and are more encouraged to develop their talents than are children in other families. Primarily for these reasons, children of parents with greater human capital form an economic elite that tends to have better jobs, less unemployment, and higher earnings. But this elite circulates over generations, and there is no convincing evidence that the degree of circulation, the degree of social mobility across generations, has been falling during the last couple of decades.</p>
<p>Some defenders of a sizeable estate tax rate claim not any major effect on inequality, but that it allegedly brings in lots of revenue with little disincentive to wealth accumulation and other behavior. However, estate and gift taxes in fiscal 2005 are expected to contribute only $24 billion in federal tax revenues, which is about 1 per cent of estimated total federal tax receipts, and just one third of federal revenue from excise taxes. The rise in exemptions may have reduced revenue from estate taxes, but this tax did not contribute much more even a decade ago. $24 billion is not small change, except to politicians, but if the estate tax were abolished, the lost revenue could be made up without difficulty with only modest increases in income or consumption taxes.</p>
<p>A main reason for the small yield of estate taxes is that very rich persons with large estates often pay little to the government since they employ skilled lawyers and accountants to help them find ways to sharply cut their estate taxes. Trust and estate planning is the specialty of about 20,000 lawyers who, along with accountants, spend their expensive time discovering ways to reduce the amount owed in estate taxes. These ways include gifts, trusts that may skip a generation, insurance trusts, and charitable trusts and foundations. These talented individuals should be spending their time in more economically productive ways. Since the average estate-planning attorney earns more than $150,000, spending on 20,000 of them would be in excess of $3 billion. If another $1 billion goes to estate accountants, total spending on tax avoidance would seem to be in excess of $4 billion. This is more than 1/6th of the revenue generated by this tax, a strikingly high percent.</p>
<p>The estate tax is a bad way to reduce the effect of inheritances on inequality in the distribution of incomes and wealth, even for families that do leave large estates. For this tax does not consider how many children, parents, other relatives, or friends share estate resources. A parent who leaves $10 million to an only child has a larger effect on the personal inequality of wealth in the next generation than does someone leaving the same amount to be divided among several children, nieces, nephews, friends, and employees. Similarly, a large bequest to successful children with high incomes raises inequality more than does the same size bequest to children with low or just average incomes.</p>
<p>This is why taxing inheritances rather than bequests would be a better way to reduce inequality in succeeding generations. That is, $10 million in bequests divided five ways should generally be taxed at much lower rates than the same amount given to one person, while $10 million divided among several well off children should also be taxed at higher rates than the same amount divided among children with modest incomes. Although an inheritance tax would be better than the estate tax, I am not advocating a direct tax on inheritances, for there is a better approach that indirectly does tax inheritances (see the discussion later of consumption taxes).</p>
<p>The estate tax also makes it harder for families to pass successful businesses on to their heirs. Despite the 2001 tax law that increased exemptions, families are still sometimes forced to sell more successful and profitable businesses upon death of the principal owner in order to pay estate duties. This is why farmers and other owners of small businesses continue to be active politically in advocating much lower estate taxes, if not their complete abolition.</p>
<p>High tax rates on estates may be thought to be universal, but in fact many countries have low taxes on estates. Moreover, some countries, including Canada and Switzerland, essentially have not taxed bequests to close family members, although they may tax capital gains on assets transferred to children.</p>
<p>I cannot go deeply in this discussion into the reasons why I believe a tax on consumption, perhaps a progressive one, instead of income and corporate taxes, should form the heart of the federal tax system. Suffice it to say that consumption taxes, unlike income taxes, do not distort savings decisions, a particularly important issue for the United States.</p>
<p>A general reliance on consumption taxes would, among other things, replace an estate tax by indirect taxes on inheritances. The tax on inheritances would be indirect because they would not be taxed when they are received, but only as they are spent. So if a family receives a large inheritance that raises their consumption several fold, the amount they would pay in consumption taxes would also increase several fold for as long as the family continues to consume at a much higher level.</p>
<p>So my conclusion is that the estate tax should go, or at least have greater reduced rates, since this tax has little effect on inequality in a knowledge economy, encourages costly avoidance behavior to take advantage of various tax loopholes, raises only a modest amount of government revenue, and reduces incentives to form family businesses and other entrepreneurial activity. Estate taxes do not even tax the right base if the aim is to reduce the effect of inheritances on inequality in the personal distribution of income and wealth.  The energy and political capital spent on supporting high estate taxes is better spent on trying to raise opportunities to children from poor families by improving their education, training, and health.</p>

While you put forth convincing arguement for abolition of estate taxes, I believe you are distorting several points through omission:</p>
<p>1- there has always been a significant "per recipiant deductable" of some $600,000+.  So, a $10 million estate divided five ways is taxed at much lower rate than the same estate inherited by a single heir.  $600,000 invested conservatively will create more gains than Joe six-pack (mister median income) can earn working 40 hours a week.</p>
<p>2- creation of a new form of taxation, such as a Federal consumption tax (and I'd like to see how that can be made progressive without creating work for an army of tax evasion accountants) - will not really erase the old forms of taxation.  Politically, the Congress will not do something so radical as to dismantle the income tax system before implementing consumption tax - and thus we will have all the old taxes, plus this new one.  More complication in an already Byzantine system.</p>
<p>3- The largest estates need to be broken up over generations - not paltry little $5M and $10M mom and pop businesses, but the $1B and up fortunes need to be dispersed.  Otherwise, the Colliers would still own 10% of South Florida, the Rockefellers would be bigger power brokers than they were in their heyday, and the heirs of Bill and Melinda Gates would own the entire moon.</p>
<p>I am in favor of increasing the "deductable" to keep pace with inflation, something where a single inheritance, invested at prevailing conservative rates for the previous 10 years, would yield a median income.</p>
<p>I would also be in favor of tax free gifts in an annual amount perhaps up to 10% of the inheritance tax free limit.</p>
<p>In the case of an inherited small family business worth some $10 or 20M, a long term low interest tax payment plan would seem to be both compassionate and just.</p>
<p>However, when the extremely wealthy pass away from this world, if they have not fulfilled their moral philanthropic duty to disperse of the bulk of their material estate to persons and causes of their choosing, I have no problem with giving the bulk of it to the federal and state government.</p>
<p>Odds are, these same deceased billionaires have also failed to pass on significant human capital (wisdom) to their heirs.  The world doesn't need a large number of Paris Hiltons.</p>

<p>I think the most important argument against the Death Tax is that it is immoral.  The idea that when my race is run, our government is going to decide how much of my hard earned (and heavily taxed) earnings they will "allow" me to distribute as I see fit infuriates me.</p>

Large estates disperse themselves over generations without any help from the government.  Do you know who the richest American families were in the 18th century?  Neither do I.  Their wealth was dispersed over many generations.</p>

<p>My impression is that there is little or no empirical support for the claim that estate taxes often force the sale of farms or small businesses. Even if a small business is valuable enough to generate an estate tax liability (and remember, many small businesses, especially those whose value is in the millions, have multiple owners) there are very generous provisions in the tax code for paying the estate tax over a long period.</p>
<p>As for the accountants, lawyers, etc., again I would like a touch more than a simple assertion to accept this. Somebody is paying $24 billion after all, and it's not poor people. </p>
<p>Nor do I  think it is reasonable to argue for the abolition of the estate tax on the grounds it produces "only" 1% of federal revenues. If we could take the tax code and break it down into one hundred items, each of which produced one percent of total revenue, would we simply abolish taxes?</p>
<p>As for the inequality issue let me just note that we are moving towards a tax system that has a strong tendency to create a hereditary aristocracy. Taxes on capital income have been reduced dramatically, and now the estate tax is up for removal. Allthe talk about human capital notwithstanding, we are in the process of creating a class of wealthy individuals who pay little or no tax. This is not a good idea.</p>

<p> Why we should cut taxes on the super-rich and stick it further into the poor people in the form of a consumption tax in 5 pages or less. Yay.</p>
<p> Consumption taxes ARE regressive. It is irresponsible and disingenuous to describe them as potentially progressive. Since you are a prize winning economist, I assume you know about the diminishing marginal utility of wealth. I feel silly reminding us of it.</p>
<p> Consumption taxes burden those who consume 100% of their earnings, namely the middle and lower class. The estate tax burdens un-charitable billionaires who want to exercise control over their empire from beyond the grave.</p>
<p> Despite the 4 billions worth of lawyer and accountant families that get fed by the estate tax system, the government still manages to collect $24 Billion to spend on social services and Bombs for Democracy. Sounds like a success for me, your plan would presumably eliminate 30,000 professional jobs and force every taxpayer to shell out $240 each to make up the difference. Thanks! Great idea, I really didn't need that money for food and rent, and God knows Paul Allen needs another helicopter so both helipads on his newest yacht will be full.</p>
<p>"The idea that when my race is run, our government is going to decide how much of my hard earned (and heavily taxed) earnings they will "allow" me to distribute as I see fit infuriates me."</p>
<p> Minimum wage is hard-earned, if you made enough surplus money in your life to be eligible for the estate tax then you were either lucky, or employed dishonest means. The estate tax only applies to millionaires. People do not become multi-millionaires or billionaires by working hard. Our GNP averages out to $33,000 per year per person, if you make more than that, someone else is making less, very likely someone who works FOR YOU without which your enterprise would not function. (Sometimes I just want to smack Americans upside the head for being so obtuse. Bunch of computer engineers getting paid $100K a year to check stocks and surf the web at work and whine about their jobs being outsourced... then you bring up taxes and all of a sudden they are noble hard-working salt of the earth. What did you say to the last homeless guy that asked you for a quarter? Yeah, I thought so.)</p>
<p>  All the estate tax says to people is, be charitible before you die or the rest of us will tax you.</p>

<p>One doesn't need to be Corey to find fault with this analysis.  I don't mean to backhand Corey here (not entirely), just saying that the argument against taxation from morality is a particularly loathesome one, and should appear so to both conservatives and liberals.</p>
<p>Conceding that, for the wealthy and poor alike, some hard work goes into earnings, some luck is also involved.  The very thing that makes markets work pragmatically -- the information gathering effects -- requires that markets also be unpredictable.  With unpredictability comes luck.  Yet there is no moral argument for lucky findings -- you don't deserve your luck.  Hence:  no moral argument for absolute private ownership.  There are good pragmatic arguments, of course.</p>
<p>Then there's this one:  property rights do not exist without some sort of public enforcement of those rights.  You cannot pass on your wealth to your deserving heirs without the government enabling you to do so.  Otherwise it goes to the angry hordes.  I don't understand how you can ignore the amount of public infrastructure that is required to sustain highly complex private markets.</p>
<p>And no, we do not need more Paris Hiltons.</p>
<p>I tend to enter the fray only when there are particularly bad arguments.  This one was exceptionally poor.  You are presumably a Republican -- go read Oliver Wendell Holmes.  He has something to say on the matter.</p>

<p><br/>
The income of the bottom 5th of American families has been flat for over a quarter century ($11,000/year in 2002 dollars).  Is there any evidence that a significant percentage of people rise above the status of their parents if they start life in the lowest quintile of American families?</p>
<p>Stephen Darwall from The University of Michigan has called into question the accuracy of your reasearch done on this topic in the past:</p>
<p><i>In 1987, Gary Becker "summed up the research by saying that mobility in the United States was so high that very little advantage was passed down from one generation to the next."  Many researchers believed that the effects of socioeconomic birthplace tended to wash out over two generations.</i></p>
<p><i>The problem is that the past research turns out to have been deeply flawed, and more recent research has shown significantly less, and significantly decreasing, mobility.</i></p>

<p>So the wealth-haters, hardly better than racists in their mindlessness, come out.  It's not enough that this group, the well-off (if hardly all "rich"), even before paying taxes, contributes more than any other to society economically by creating businesses and jobs.  It's not enough that the group that works the most, and the most efficiently, and is taxed at the highest rate thoughout their lifetimes.  It's not enough that they pay the vast majority of all income taxes.  It's not enough, after a lifetime of hard work, that they must spend their dotage worrying about unloading their wealth one way or another to avoid the death tax.  No, after all, their just the evil rich, who deserve that the government take away half their money yet again on their deathbed, defying their last wishes.</p>

<p>Interestingly death is already one of the best tax breaks you can get. The stepped up basis in assets once passed on by bequest not only allows for nonrecognition of gain on inheritance, but gives the recipient a fair market value basis. This basically forgives all the tax inherent in the assets at death. This makes a kind of conceptual sense if we have decided that only amount above a certain point e.g. 1 million in estate tax, should be taxed at death. Without an estate tax I can't think of much reason for it. Any discussion of the elimination of the estate tax should include the possibility of elmininating the stepped up basis at death.</p>

<p>Becker's main argument against an estate tax seems to be that he favors a consumption tax.  Since Becker thinks the consumption tax is best, he would likely write similar essays for all non-consumption taxes (i.e, abolish and replace with consumption tax).  To the extent that it is unlikely that we will have a consumption tax as the main source of government revenue, I think Becker should answer the estate tax question 'ceterus paribus'.</p>

<p>As is usual,a very interesting subject.I remember reading an old book of my mother's by James Gould Couzzens where an elderly judge admonishes an attorney who is rabid about high taxes destroying  fortunes by reminding him that society is unstable when so much wealth is concentrated in a few hands.The other side of the coin is that the abilty to inherit rather than have the crown take the estate was considered an advance in English justice.I wasn't aware of the yearly revenue,which is a factor,but not that much after I know the details.I was, as I often am ,bemused by Corey's statements.Evidently ,he doesn't feel wealth can be created,just redistributed.This is a canard of the under educated left.I have a feeling the people who come away fom college with no math,no foreign languages,no econ,no sciences(but a lot of PC studies classes )haven't ben trained to critically think.This could explain the rants,which they probably even believe.</p>

<p> Nothing gets me ridiculed faster than attacking the Horatio Alger myth.</p>
<p> Interestingly enough lincoln, I nearly had a minor in math on my way to my electrical engineering degree. I never once took a "PC studies" class, unless you count law courses taught by Law &amp; Economics devotees.</p>
<p> I understand that "wealth" can be created, at least in the sense of exploiting a previously dormant resource. I am arguing that concentrations of wealth do not correlate to hard work nor moral merit. Wealth would not be created without workers who labor and invent. Industrialists, who "commission" such labor, take a larger share of the profits than all of the workers combined.</p>
<p>  Then you have the problem of "investors", who do no actual work and merely risk surplus wealth on the ventures of others. Again, the investor gets an exponentially larger share of any gain vs. the employees of the enterprise whose ideas and labor caused the gain. (Even in relatively progressive "employee stock option" companies, the workers collectively will always own significantly less than senior management. I've seen it across the board.)</p>
<p> Where we differ is that I place moral authority on the worker, and you place moral authority on the capitalist. I see profit as a taking, you see it as the divine right of kings.</p>
<p> You are perhaps mistaking my having read Das Kapital before I read Adam Smith for economic ignorance. To the extent that you believe there is only one orthodoxy in the world of economics, I think it is you who need to study some more.</p>
<p> What you say about the under-educated left may be true, but I do not know or talk with those people. If it is your intention to demean people who attempt to place morals and ethics above logic and numbers, then perhaps you were born in the wrong time. Been there done that.</p>
<p> I would have thought that the 20th century taught us the problem with turning over all policy to the technocrats. It seems that memories are short and the history of facism really is cyclical.</p>
<p> Inheritance was considered an advance at a time when the crown was corrupt and tyrannical. Looking back to that time ignores the centuries of development in the realm of democratic checks on tyranny. If you are looking to check the government then you have a choice between the wealthy elites, or the polis. Problem is the wealthy elites are also capable of even greater tyrannies.</p>

<p>Corey: as I'm sure you're aware, every realistic consumption tax proposal includes either exemptions on "necessities" or a universal rebate, thereby making it progressive.<br/>
<p><br/>
"if you made enough surplus money in your life to be eligible for the estate tax then you were either lucky, or employed dishonest means. The estate tax only applies to millionaires. People do not become multi-millionaires or billionaires by working hard."<br/>
<p><br/>
Not solely by working hard. It also takes financial discipline, and to some extent avoiding bad luck, which is quite different from requiring good luck. Investing $3300 a year at 7% for 45 years gets you to over $1 million. That might be difficult for those earning $30k or so, but it's not impossible. After all, people who only make $25k aren't starving. (And of course it would be far easier if the regressive payroll tax were abolished).</p></p></p>

<p> A rebate doesn't make a tax progressive, it simply exempts those people at the bottom that would be otherwise put out on the street (or stop voting republican) because of the tax. The tax is still flat for everyone else.</p>
<p> As one gets richer, one approaches the limit of one's ability to purchase consumer goods, and the effect of the consumer tax diminishes. The result<br/>
is that the burden is felt within a particular band, namely the middle class.</p>
<p> Further, exemptions for "necessities" are paternalistic and intrusive. People here often profess to libertarianism, why then don't they get outraged by the government presuming to tell poor people that they can't buy a stereo but they can buy milk. I personally am nowhere near being a libertarian, but it seems to me that should bother them. (Maybe it does)</p>
<p>"After all, people who only make $25k aren't starving."</p>
<p> Depending on where they reside they aren't really living either. Have you ever gotten by on less than $35K a year since leaving school? Did you save 10%? It does not make sense to talk about things we all know will not happen in reality as if they possibly might.</p>
<p> I agree on the abolishment of the employee paid portion of the payroll tax, but a flat consumption tax would just do the same thing.<br/>
I think it is telling of the priorities of this administration that lowering the top tax rate and abolishing the estate tax were the first things chosen in their plan for "reform". It would be no less regulatory and intrusive to abolish the employee paid payroll taxes and raise the property tax.</p>

<p>When it comes to taxes, the states will often step in when there is an opportunity given to them on a silver platter.  If the federal estate tax is abolished, would at least some of the states that do not currently have estate taxes seize the opportunity and impose them?  Would states that currently have an estate tax raise theirs? Differences in state taxation rates and schemes produce economic distortions too.  Would these distortions worsen?  These questions constitute the difference between dynamic scoring and static scoring.  Dr. Becker is taking the static scoring approach.<br/><br/>
<br/></p>
<p>There is no compelling political or economic reason to abolish the federal "death tax."  It has been repealed already--for 99 percent of estates.  Although its existence is largely symbolic, symbols are important sometimes.  So long as the estate tax rate is not so unduly high as to discourage the incentive to work and accumulate wealth, this is one tax that should be left alone.</p>

<p>All a progressive tax means is that higher rates of the activity being taxed are taxed more heavily. Thus a consumption tax that taxes the first $13,000 at a 1% rate and anything over $13,000 at a 50% rate is a progressive tax, b/c the total tax rate increases with each additional unit of the taxed activity. For each dollar of consuption over 13,000 the tax rate on their total consumption tax approaches 50%. Thus those who consume more are taxed at a higher level porportionately than those who consume at a lesser level. </p>
<p>e.g. total tax rate on someone who consumes 13,000 is 1% of consumption <br/>
someone who consumes at $20,000 tax is taxed at 18.15% of consumption<br/>
someone who consumes at $100,000 is taxed at 41.63% of consumption</p>
<p>The current income tax system works the same way, just with more layers and in regard to income (but all income is is taxing the present value of furture consumption), any sort of rebate/exemption/differing rate will produce a progressive tax, the only way to have a nonprogressive tax is to have it tax everyone proportionately (e.g. everyone is taxed at 1% of consumption)</p>
<p>The reason everyone says consumption taxes are regressive is that they are regressive as to income/wealth, not b/c they are regressive to consumption. Indeed  a consumption tax that is progressive to income is possible; but it would require incredible complexity and reporting problems. Maybe a consumption tax that was progressive as to consumption (like the example I just gave with different numbers of course) would be a better solution. There is nothing inherently regressive or progressive about either the consumption tax or income tax. </p>
<p>I recommend David Bradford, formerly of Princeton, and David Weisbach's (of U of Chicago Law)work on the X tax as a fascinating discussion of this issue. <br/>

<p>Venturing a bit off topic to the skewness of compensation in corporate America:</p>
<p>I work for a not so hypothetical company of about 500 employees.  The average compensation breaks down roughly so:</p>
<p>CEO &amp; VPs <br/>
~10 people average $500k/yr + ~100,000 options</p>
<p>Upper management <br/>
~20 people average $250k/yr + ~20,000 options</p>
<p>Middle management &amp; upper tier technical + ~1,000 options<br/>
~70 people average $125K/yr</p>
<p>Lower tier technical, infrastructure, etc. + ~100 options<br/>
~250 people average $45K/yr (spread $8/hr to $60K/yr)</p>
<p>Sales / commission based<br/>
~150 people average irrelevant, highly varied, distribution actually very close to the above, capping around $250K/yr</p>
<p>-----------------------</p>
<p>Only the top two tiers, or upper 6% of my company will ever have to consider hiring an estate attorney.  The rest of us would have to make a extremely lucky investments, or pursue DINK lifestyles to get to any significant net worth, because we are still consuming most of our income.</p>
<p>Needless to say, mobility between the layers is extremely rare, more likely to hire a new VP or upper manager from outside than to promote from within.  Entry into the top 3 tiers requires a good education and extensive prior experience, typically at a similar level in another company.  I tie this back to the estate tax theme by noting that noone in the top three tiers appears to have been raised in a ghetto.</p>
<p>The lower tier is accessible to all, but note the salary discrepancy.  These people not only consume all of their income, they require dual incomes to support a home and family, and still they will have a difficult time saving any money for retirement.  They might educate their children, and their children might have a shot at a third tier job someday, but they are essentially going nowhere themselves.</p>
<p>Arguably, the lower tier does not do "wealth creation" type work, but some of my layer - upper tier technical - certainly does.  You may point to how well we are compensated compared to the line workers, but we are not offered anything approaching a participation stake in the future value of the company.  We could go elsewhere, but elsewhere, the story is the same.</p>
<p>The wealth creators in my tier are typically malcontent over this state of affairs, but since we lack the resources to start our own ventures, we stick with the salaried jobs.</p>
<p>Our CEO came from money, and risked a significant minority of his fortune in funding our company as a startup.  He occasionally puts in long hours, but across a year, I doubt he totals over 1500 true "company" hours.  You could argue that he's efficient, but from my perspective, he started from an advantaged position, took a small risk, and got lucky.  He hired a highly professional compensation department to ensure retention of people like me, and justification of his salary, benefits, options, bonuses, etc.  Every year, compensation tests the lower limits of efficiency for the employees, and the upper limits of credibility for the top tier.</p>
<p>Whine whine whine - the unfairness of it all.</p>
<p>Would a stronger estate/inheritance tax correct this situation?  Not immediately.</p>
<p>Would abolition of estate/inheritance taxes excacerbate this situation?  I'd say, definitely.</p>
<p>The upper tier already acts like a nobility class, and there is more than one ivy league degree up there.  With the material wealth playing fields skewed 100:1 (in the case of stock options, which can be worth 10x salary for the upper tiers, some years), I, in the third tier, won't be able to afford ivy league schools for my children, waterfront property for my retirement, or any of the other highly exclusive comodities in life.</p>
<p>Oh, sorry, whining again.</p>
<p>It's a pattern that's repeated again and again.  Those who have, act to protect what they have, so that the have-nots never will get a chance at it.</p>
<p>The drastic curve of compensation in corporate life mirrors life in general, and if those at the top are able to establish and maintain dynasties, they will.  The United States is already being run by groups that do not protect the interests of the majority, they managed to secure ~50% of the popular vote in the last two dynastic presidential elections through some interesting plays on values.  Abolition of estate taxes plays on some of the same values that got the Republicans elected by people who they are going to trod on economically.  Joe six-pack may not himself have to worry about estate taxes, but if he did, he sure wouldn't like them.  And he sure wishes he's win that lottery so he'd have the problem.  And, ya know, even if he doesn't win the lottery, it's just not right, all them hard workin' CEOs having to pay another tax.</p>

<p>"If the electorate isn't careful, the system may become so biased to the powerful that it falls out of popular control entirely."</p>
<p> I don't know, do you feel like there is any real popular control NOW? We may already be there. Certainly there is no popular control in the working world. Engineers still laugh at the idea of forming unions to protect their rights.</p>
<p> In tech companies I worked for, there was some upward mobility, from the "suitably trained" upper-middle tier into management. Even hereditary dynasties occasionally need new blood to renew the gene pool. (Witness the sordid genetic history of the English royals)</p>
<p> The problem I saw was that the individuals choosen to rise up the ladder were most often not the individuals who had created wealth. In fact, they were most often the individuals who were the best at stealing credit for the successes of others and sucking up to the whims of management.</p>
<p> On one level, anyone being chosen for promotion encourages the rest of the troops. It really only takes one or two internal promotions a year to keep the engineers working 70 hour weeks. By picking the syncophants, management sends a direct message that devotion to the hierarchy is preferred over devotion to truth.</p>
<p> This wouldn't be a problem except that it leads to discontent in the minds of innovators, who by nature are often "outside the box" anti-authoritarian personalities. Many of them get driven out or leave voluntarily after making significant contributions in the more free-wheeling startup phase. This is one of the reasons you often don't see lightning striking twice after tech-companies IPO or otherwise "go legit." You get a horizontal migration of talent that only really benefits in times when there is a high demand (that is, not now).</p>
<p> The bottom line is that the qualities necessary to be upwardly socially mobile in disfunctional American corporations are opposed to the qualities necessary to create wealth in the same. The whole system is based upon appropriation, whereby management is credited for the gain (and disproportionately rewarded) to which it only indirectly contributed. This is why I have no qualms about asserting that few to none of the rich EARNED their position on their own merit.</p>
<p> Investment may grow the economy if it is effectively directed to concentrations of innovators, but the growth falls in proportion to the initial distribution of shares in the economy. No one is benefited who was not already in line, except via inefficient and paternalistic methods like trickle-down.<br/>

<p>THE ESTATE TAX</p>
<p>The estate tax is favored by cynical politicians who know that heirs of multimillion dollar estates are outnumbered by non-heirs. Thus, more voters benefit from the estate tax than lose out.</p>
<p>These cynical politicians are usually populists, and so are on the Left. Their campaign and fundraising rhetoric slurs heirs as greedy and undeserving. After all, heirs didn't earn their inheritance. The little guy loses out if the greedy rich are able to spend their dollars how they choose.</p>
<p>CYNICISM: BRINGING DEMOCRATS TOGETHER</p>
<p>The Left benefits politically by restricting the use of capital by rich private persons, natural or state-created. First, corporations and rich individuals have less money to spend on elections and lobbying for free market policies. Second, the extremist rhetoric keeps Leftist politicians well-financed and in office, because extremist rhetoric energizes the far Left, which maximizes the number of small "hard money" donations incoming to tax-exempt liberal groups and the coffers of liberal loudmouths like Chuck Schumer.</p>
<p><br/>
HOW TO HELP THE POOR, WITHOUT HYPOCRISY</p>
<p>The way to improve the lot of poor people is to grow the economy. Don't take my word for it, take the word of Professor Bhagwati of Columbia University, who used that very strategy while an economist on the Indian Planning Commission to raise the minimum income of India's poor (defined as the bottom 30% of India's wage-earners). He is quite explicit in "In Defense of Globalization" that:</p>
<p>"[G]rowth was not a passive, trickle-down strategy for helping the poor. It was an active, pull-up strategy instead." p.54<br/>
... <br/>
"[G]rowth had to the principal (but, as I argue below, not the only) strategy for raising the incomes, and hence consumption and living standards of, the poor." p.54<br/>
...<br/>
"A suitable growth policy can always nip the immiserating growth paradox in the bud, ensuring that growth does amount to an increase in the size of the pie." p.55<br/>
...<br/>
"We must also improve the poor's access to investment by making sure that bureaucrats are replaced by markets wherever possible. As I remarked earlier, the anti-market protesters do not adequately appreciate that, as has been documented by numerous development economists who have studied both the working of controls and the rise of corruption in developing countries, far too many bureaucrats impose senseless restrictions just to collect bribes or exercise power. Letting markets function is therefore often an egalitarian allocation mechanism." p.58</p>
<p>I ask you this, my friends. Does the estate tax "let the market function"? If not, why is Corey opposed to an egalitarian allocation mechanism? Isn't he supposed to be an egalitarian? Or is he just an elitist in populist clothing?<br/>

<p>I disagree.  The particular method that I used to obtain my wealth might have involved luck, but the fact that I obtained it had more to do with hard work and determination.  I guess you could argue that inheriting intelligence is lucky, but there are plenty of smart people who are not wealthy.</p>
<p>There is very little difference between taxation and theft.  Either way, someone takes your stuff by force.  At least you can argue that income tax pays for the police protection they receive.

<p>Upon graduation, I made $36K per year, and I was a wage slave.  I bought a home in the ghetto (best investment of my life, as the ghetto retreated and values tripled in 10 years), and didn't have enough free time to do anything substantial in my life.  </p>
<p>My quality of life was better earning $14K per year, working about 800 hours.  </p>
<p>At $36K per year working 2000 hours, I was able to buy a new car and a invest in a small house, contributing more to society, I suppose, but net enjoyment of life was seriously diminished.</p>
<p>In today's America, there are precious few choices of employment that will pay a reliable $50 per hour, while allowing more than a few weeks per year of vacation.  Unless you happen to inherit a moderately sized fortune which you can effectively invest and manage for about 100 hours a year.</p>

<p>BECKER: "Suffice it to say that consumption taxes, unlike income taxes, do not distort savings decisions, a particularly important issue for the United States."</p>
<p>In other words, you're only taxed when you spend. If you don't spend, you get to accrue compounding interest and keep it or pass it on. It means instead of borrowing, poor people can simply spend less. This will get rid of a lot of junk economic behavior, as poor people opt not to spend money on frivolities. The only problem is that there is a limit to how much poor people can cut their costs (a reason for progressivity), and the progressive consumption tax would need to be administered a cost which would fall on the seller of the goods being consumed, which means an across-the-board increase in sticker prices, which affects buyers with lower savings disproportionately. (Unless Becker is in favor of socialist price controls, which we all know would lead to rationing....)</p>

<p>I don't think "the US is willing to offshore" any business. Multinationals that are thought of as American corporations are offshoring. But that is not a government action. I think the inability of you to make that distinction is telling. George W. Bush has not implemented a executive order commanding multinationals headquartered here to offshore.

But don't go to Hong Kong or Singapore, former British colonies with an Anglo-style legal system and governance, including property rights, because they, apparently, don't have rule of law. Evil empires never export rule of law. Especially not in Iraq, which is writing its Constitution, or Afghanistan, which already wrote its.

<p>It means cheaper goods for poor American workers, which means increased purchasing power for poor American consumers (who are also workers), which means more money potentially going into savings for poor people. You want poor Americans to have an increased chance of accumulating wealth, don't you, Corey? Or would you prefer that poor Americans not be able to buy cheap goods they like at Wal-Mart and Target? You like higher sticker prices for poor Americans, is that it? Because higher sticker prices in American stores are in essence a tax on poor Americans.

<p>Joe Merchant,</p>
<p>Responses to your comments enumerated above;</p>
<p>1.  The historic $600,000 exemption was per donor, not per donee.</p>
<p>2.  A progressive federal consumtion tax can be easily achieved by expanding IRAs through removing the $3600 annual cap and allowing taxable distributions at any time.  In essence, this would exempt net current savings from the tax base leaving consumption to be taxed on a graduated basis.  William Andrews of Harvard suggested a variant of this thirty years ago and Sam Nunn offered it as legislation last decade.  In my opinion inter vivos as well as testamentary gifts (as distinguished from charitable contributions) should not be deducted from the base.  Alternatively, a sales tax style tax could be made progressive by exempting basic needs such as food, medicine and shelter.  You are correct that such exemptions would introduce the potential for gamesmanship and complexity, but it is not clear that it would be any worse than our present system.  However, this alternative would be especially susceptable to the "additional tax" risk that you mention.  </p>
<p>3.  Huge estates diminish over time without the help of the government.  Just look at how little is left of the original Rockefeller and Kennedy estates, and through good planning they have paid little in estate tax.  Of course, some of that planning has been accomplished by the use of private foundations.  The mischief those foundations have caused is staggering. <br/>

<p>I am not sure that Becker is correct in observing that the estate tax is inefficient because of the number of lawyers and accountants employed to avoid it.  Although I havent' seen any research on the point (and there must be some) my personal observation is that there are many expensive lawyers and accountants employed at the upper margins of any tax system.  Are more lawyers and accountants employed per dollar collected from taxpayers with large lifetime plus death transfers than from individual and corporate income tax payers paying over 30% marginal rates on ten million dollars of income?  I doubt it.  The difference is that the federal income tax collects much of its revenue by withholding from lower- and middle-income tax payers who cannot save much by hiring lawyers.  At the upper margins of income taxation, lawyering is probably more prevalent than at the upper margins of estate taxation.</p>

<p>winfield -- the argument isn't that theivery is moral, but that taxation is moral.  We have no absolute right to private ownership that can be abrogated by the government.

<p>This is a ridiculous statement.  If you want to call any increase in cost a "tax" -- well that's pretty tortured, in that the traditional definition of tax is a cost directed to the government, and not just anywhere -- but fine, do so.  But the "tax" you describe is no more a tax on poor people than a tax on everyone.  Sure, higher prices are bad, and poor people, because they are poor, might feel the pinch a bit more, but that doesn't make it solely a tax on poor people -- in as much as it can be called a tax at all, which it isn't.</p>

<p>You are falling into the trap of zero sum thinking.  Rather than worry about the top one percent versus the bottom twenty, look at the state of the bottom twenty percent.  The places where "poor" people are doing the best are the places that have the largest disparity between rich and poor.</p>

<p>R - "ridiculous" is a little harsh. The idea has merit even if the word "tax" isn't a perfect fit. If congress decided to set a policy of no trade with China, there would be costs. These costs would be paid through higher prices on cheap consumer goods that aren't usually purchased by the upper class.</p>

<p>OC -- I don't think you fully grasp my point.  It isn't just police protection that you would have to forgo, but the entire infrastructure set in place by the government to create private markets.  An important one would be the mint.  Then we also have the SEC, the federal reserve, etc.  It isn't just that you require a government to protect your wealth (you do) but that the existence of private wealth in non-cattle form is predicated upon a government.  Without a government, you could presumably acquire a flock of sheep, and trade for goods and services.  But a more liquid form of wealth requires a government.  Otherwise it does not exist.</p>
<p>This is why arguments that begin "taxes are immoral" are so very unappealing.  It seems obvious that they aren't, and it makes one question whether the speaker genuinely believes what he is saying.</p>

<p>Daniel -- </p>
<p>I see your point, but it isn't only use of the word "tax" that bothered me, but the unsupported assertion that the "tax" was exclusively "on the poor."</p>
<p>There is actually evidence that the very rich and very poor alike buy basic consumer goods on the cheap.  We need to define more readily what kinds of goods we are talking about before the statement can be proven true.  For instance, evidence suggests that the rich don't buy name brand cereal.  There isn't much evidence that rich people shy away from bargains.</p>
<p>There are other examples -- such as state lotteries -- which actually do act as taxes upon the poor.  State lotteries are both (1) taxes -- in that the money goes to the government -- and (2) primarily targeted to the poor -- because poor people buy more lottery tickets.  I don't think (1) or (2) necessarily applies to the example.  It was so hastily thrown out there that I think it deserves whatever I called it.</p>

<p>I'm hardly a liberal, RWS.  Just pointing out some numbers.  Look at income distribution, not in percentages, but in actual dollars.  Two sets of American families, roughly the same size.</p>

$4,010,520,000,000 is divided between the other</p>
<p>That is the difference between the top 5th of American families and the bottom 5th.  But few in the top 5th are asked to pay estate tax.  That falls mainly on the top 1%.  Dr. Becker points out this tax brings in about $25,000,000,000/year.</p>

<p>Thanks for your responses.</p>
<p>Yes, my tax law is a little weak - and I do not feel particularly compelled to learn today's inheritance tax law details, as they will undoubtedly change before they affect me directly - even if that is next year.</p>
<p>I have, however, "Lived in a brownstone, lived in a ghetto, I've lived all over this town." (Talking Heads)  </p>
<p>Nobody likes to pay tax.</p>
<p>The rich have the power to have exceptions made for themselves, whether they are massive landholders (farmers), corporate tycoons, or .com lucky kids.</p>
<p>Uncapping the IRA is an interesting form of consumption tax, I could almost get behind that, but it will be hard to phase in during deficit spending (gee, when was the last time we didn't have deficit spending, oh, I digress...) due to the loss of revenue for 20-30 years while worker bees horde their income.  Exceptions for food, medical care, etc. are less attractive to me - due to the petty bickering that will flare up along the boundaries - are cigarettes groceries? No, well, how about the double chocolate fudge ice cream that is now being peddled by the tobacco companies, yes?  Well, what about nutraceutical performance enhancing beverages at $5 a pop?  Same thing happens in health care for things like breast implants, cosmetic tattoos, etc.  Better to have a system that is inherently arguement free, unless you are a lawyer; and there aren't any lawyers elected to federal office drafting our laws, are there?</p>
<p>And, then, if anybody outside the bottom two quintiles cares, there are those folks who think that IRA is some Jewish banker who wants them to deposit their money with him - where they won't have access to it for things like food, rent, clothes for the kids, etc.  And, in a sense, they're not far off the mark.  Uncapping the IRA won't make a hill of beans difference to a lot of people.  In fact, if these folks wanted to save in an IRA, it's practically uncapped for them today.</p>
<p>Until my company put up matching funds for their 401(k), I never had a tax exempt retirement account - instead, I got lucky and leveraged myself heavily into real-estate around the turn of the millenium.  Any IRA that I could have accumulated with my real-estate investment principle would look pretty sad compared to what I have now, especially considering the negative return many mutual funds had during the same timeframe.</p>
<p>At least we have enough transparency in our system that we can see the rich padding their own pockets, hopefully that will remain in place and serve as some deterrent to falling down the rabbit hole of &gt;99% in the hands of 

<p>Oh, wait, didn't I just hear the same arguement against equalizing rich and poor?  Yeah, but Communisim was a lie - examples of extreme aristocracy abound in history, and around the globe today.</p></p>

Oh, and everyone loves to bash the yacht tax... anyone who didn't see that result coming wasn't thinking more than 1/2 step ahead.</p>
<p>Of course there are other countries in the world where you can buy a yacht - in fact, many of the big brokers in the US specialize in bringing in these massive luxury craft from overseas.</p>
<p>If you pass a tax on cigarettes sold from stores on the north side of the street, you might expect more cigs to be sold on the south side (there is a grocery store in my neighborhood that faces 90 degrees to the main street to circumvent a liquor restriction law.)</p>
<p>I think the yacht tax might have been pushed through by a few schemeing plutocrats just so they have an arguement to throw at the towel boys for the next 50 years.</p>
<p>Nah, plutocrats aren't really that clever.<br/>

<p>Joe, I think we'll have to wait a few years to see who was clever.</p>
<p>Even if the poorest 60% of Americans were taxed at 100%, the revenue wouldn't equal the federal budget. The budget keeps getting bigger, the plutocrats keep getting their taxes cut, and the debt keeps growing.</p>
<p>I can't tell what's going to happen, but I suspect the poor will just eat the rich in the end.</p>

<p>From Europa, regarding our histories and the news i can grab your are already a fascist state (not like nazi but like napoleonian days).<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
And:<br/><br/>
"You can fool 33% of the people all of the time.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
You can fool 51% of the people some of the time."<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
is true ... except if you use war or terror . We hadgreat examples in Franceof those with Robespierre and Napoleon.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
And a fair consomption tax is a myth. When we already have a hard time getting fair data about what is owned ...<br/><br/>
How would a state find out one bought his yoat in korea ? I bought this book on ebay from a russian student ... or that my dad paid a relaionship to help him build this wall. And so on .<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Economics is the science of HUMAN economy. Not some sort of robots who do everything in a predictive ways. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
And you are paid to find out how to best rules a world that does not exists . That s tell a lot about your axiom about the relationship binding wealth to effectivness. <br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Though you are right you are really smart. Finding out how to earn your living while doing useless research is really clever. I bet you have to work really hard to keep everyone from finding out.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Thankfuylly a lot of dumbass prefer keeping working really hard to keep the social consistency to our nations and avoid civil wars as in the nineteenth century than fighting such social abuses.<br/><br/>
I hope it will last as i prefer a mad world for my family than civil war ... it helps for them not dying.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
But at least have the decency to avoid telling bullshits and tell that they are lazy. It is the least you can do to reward them behing dumb (or smart enough) to understand why they do not turn violent.<br/></p>

<p>I don't understand how you go from "the estate tax" is inefficient as in our information age most of the wealth is given through education to "we should tax consumption".<br/></p>
<p>The obvious conclusion is to tax education for wealthy families and education credits for the poor ... <br/>
Isn't that obvious ?</p>

<p>Many of the defenses of the inheritance tax argue that the person making the bequest has his fortune as a result of "hard work."  Does anyone have any way of measuring how much of a person's income is the result of hard work?  I guess one can use social mobility as a proxy, but that doesn't necessarily prove that hard work is in play.  Places with more social mobility may be places where childhood advantages are swamped by randomness and not by meritocracy.</p>
<p>Libertarians seem to take as a matter of faith that the smaller the government the more social mobility, despite a lack of any evidence for that assertion.  Nordic countries have much more social mobility than the Anglophone countries, and in the U.S., large-government states have more social mobility than small-government states.</p>
<p>The irony is that the generations that grew up in the New Deal era were the most socially mobile because of progressive policies.  With those policies, hard work actually paid off, and so those generations felt most entitled to keep "their own" money and in the Reagan era dismantled the paths to upward mobility for those of us attempting to rise above our station in 21st century.</p>
<p>My support for the estate tax is based on two propositions.</p>
<p>#1: Ensuring a system where a person's income is based on how hard they work and not parental advantage requires public funding of education, food, health care for children and young adults to even out the playing field.  This requires revenue, which requires taxation.</p>
<p>#2: We should avoid taxing as much as possible, income earned though hard work. Inheritance is income earned by having the right parent, and not by hard work (unless the heir worked hard to kill their parent, in which case, they shouldn't get the income either.)  Therefore we should tax inheritance completely before start taxing wages.  <br/>
