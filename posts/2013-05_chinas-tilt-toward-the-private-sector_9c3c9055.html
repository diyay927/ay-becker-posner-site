<p>In a speech this month to Communist party officials (reported
in yesterday’s New York Times), Li Keqiang, the recently chosen Prime Minister
of China, called for greater reliance on the private sector and reduced
dependence on governmental regulations and oversight of the economy. In a
remarkable admission he said “The market is the creator of social wealth and
the wellspring of self-sustaining economic development.” Several troubling
developments in the Chinese economy led to Li’s speech.</p>
<p>China has had very rapid economic growth during the
past 30 years that lifted many hundreds of millions of Chinese out of dire
poverty. However, during the first quarter of 2013, China’s GDP expanded by
“only” 7.7% compared to a year earlier. Although China’s rate of growth is still fast compared to other nations, it is considerably lower than its growth during
earlier years. For example, from 2003 to 2011, China’s GDP grew
at rates that ranged from about 9% to over 14%. While the last quarter may be only a temporary decline in China’s growth rate, it is consistent with a slowing
of growth during the past several years, and with other adverse developments
in the Chinese economy.</p>
<p>The Chinese economy has used low wages to specialize in
labor-intensive products for the export market. This model is breaking down
because wages have risen greatly during past decade, and export markets have
shrunk because of reduced demands from the sluggish economies of the European
Union, Japan, and the United States. </p>
<p>Chinese growth has been very uneven, as urban areas have
prospered much more than rural areas. This has greatly increased income
inequality, especially between farmers and factory workers. The increase in
inequality has been magnified by China’s policy of restricting migration from
farms to cities, and by not providing the same education and health care to
these migrants that is available to other city residents.</p>
<p>China has encouraged investment and discouraged consumption
by allowing the state-run banking system to provide investors with low interest
rates and easy credit terms, and by price controls and other restrictions on the
provision of consumer goods. As a result, private consumption accounts for only about
35% of China’s GDP, compared with over 70% in the United States. Since China’s
exports are expected to rise more slowly in the future, in part because its
currency will appreciate in value relative to the dollar and other major
currencies, the domestic market will become a more important destination for
China’s production.</p>
<p>These are some of the problems that explain Prime Minister’s
Li desire to unleash the power of the private sector to galvanize China’s
economy. A good place to start is with the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that
are still very important in manufacturing, banking, energy, and
telecommunications. These SOEs frequently have protected economic positions
because competitors are not allowed to enter; for example, three state-operated
enterprises divide up the telecom sector. Studies indicate that SOEs are on the
whole considerably less efficient than private companies, partly because SOEs
get many subsides, including loans on subsidized terms from the state-run
banking system, and soft budget constraints.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is particularly important to curtail the
lending and other practices of state-owned banks, and to allow private domestic
and foreign banks to become more important providers of credit. This would
encourage private enterprises by giving them access to credit on terms that are
market driven, and that are more comparable to the terms available to the SOEs.</p>
<p>The many millions of migrants from rural sectors to urban
areas should be fully legitimatized, so that they have the same rights to
education, health, and credit as persons born in cities. This would help reduce
inequality and increase productivity by speeding up the migration out of the less
efficient parts of the rural sector into more efficient factories and service
activities.</p>
<p>The financial crisis and major recession that was brought about
in part by excesses in the private banking sector in the United States and some
other developed countries led to a widespread reaction against capitalism and
the private sector. This happened as well in China for a couple of years as the state sector expanded relative to the private sector. </p>
<p>China’s new leaders have now made clear that the country needs
to rely much more on the creativity and resourcefulness of the private sector if it
is to move beyond middle income status, and become a major economic power as
measured not only by aggregate GDP, but also by per capita GDP. It remains to
be seen whether even the new leaders can overcome the strong opposition of SOEs and
other special interest groups to the implementation of a major shift toward the
private sector.</p>
