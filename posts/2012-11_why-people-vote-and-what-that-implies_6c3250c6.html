			The number of voters in the recent US presidential election
was down by about 5 million voters from 2008, yet still about 120 million
Americans voted this month. President Obama had one of the smallest winning percentages
in the popular vote of incumbent presidents, but he still won by over 3
million voters.
<p>This raises the very old question of why people vote in
large elections when their chances of being a pivotal voter are virtually zero,
and when voting takes time and is often inconvenient. The electorate is surely
conscious of the cost to them of voting since, for example, turnout is usually
much smaller when the weather is very bad. The common answer nowadays about
this so-called paradox of voting is not that voters are irrational, but rather
that they vote for reasons other than to influence outcomes. They may vote to
indicate their moral support for particular candidates, or because they believe
they express a precious right when they vote, or for other non-instrumental
reasons.</p>
<p>These explanations do not say a lot without further
analysis, but they do give possible directions for trying to understand the
fundamental question of why and how people vote. Jorg Spenkuch, a graduate
student at the University of Chicago, using data for German elections provides
some answers. He shows that about 1/3 of the voters who prefer small parties,
such as the Greens, acted “pivotally”, and voted instead for parties that had
much better chances of winning certain elections. If voters mainly want to
express moral support for their favorite candidates, why do so many supporters
of small parties that are very unlikely to win often vote for candidates of one
of the big parties because they do not want to “throw away” their votes?</p>
<p>Since the great majority of voters presumably do not expect
to influence election outcomes, who they support is influenced
disproportionately by campaign rhetoric, debates among candidates that have
little intellectual content, and by other methods of persuasion that are not
very informative about the candidates. I like to say that consumers put more
time and effort into deciding which cereal to buy and into other small consumer
choices than in gathering information on economic and other issues about presidential
candidates. </p>
<p>But I am not claiming that voters are less “rational” than
consumers of everyday products. Individuals pay more attention to what they buy
than whom they vote for because what they buy has a direct and tangible effect
on their wellbeing. Since the incentives to become well informed are radically
different,  “rational” voting
implies very different kinds of behavior than does rational choice of cereals
or peanut butter. </p>
<p>Given the little effort that voters put into determining
policy positions of different candidates, this improves the chances of
candidates who are charismatic, look honest and caring, and project images that
they have attractive visions of what they want to do even when they really have
no well thought out beliefs about how to proceed if they get elected. This
analysis, and the greater competition usually present in the private sector
than in the political arena, imply that campaign rhetoric and campaign
advertising will generally be less informative and less honest than is the
typical private advertising. Of course, voters also value debates and campaign
advertisements for the entertainment they provide (this is true of some
advertising of goods as well).</p>
<p>Votes are more likely to matter in local contested
elections, so one would expect voters to be better informed on local issues and
local candidates than on more national issues and ational candidates. This is one reason why
decentralized government is more likely to be responsive to the wishes of the
electorate than is centralized government.</p>
<p>Of course, I agree that contested elections, the
foundation of a democratic society, are far better than a system where
there are no elections and a single Party decides who holds various government
positions. Even weak competition among parties for political office with voters
who are not well informed is usually far better than no competition at all.
Winston Churchill famously said many years ago, “It has been said that
democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that
have been tried”. This conclusion may not be quite as true in the modern Web
world as it was in Churchill’s time, but it still contains a fundamental truth.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in determining which decisions should be made
by the political process in a democracy, it is important to remember that
individuals have little incentive to be well informed on political issues. As a
result, their votes may not effectively reflect their interests or much knowledge of the issues. </p>
