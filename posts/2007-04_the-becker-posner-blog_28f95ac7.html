			In my recent post on health care reform, I mistakenly suggested that all poor people are eligible for Medicaid. In fact, only about a third of uninsured adults are eligible, as eligibility is largely limited to (poor) parents, children, and the elderly.

The Pacific Research Institute takes issue with my criticism of its calculation of the costs of the U.S. tort system, and has asked me to give the link to its point by point response,which is at http://www.pacificresearch.org/press/opd/2007/opd_07-04-23lm.html, and also to its concise response (which I believe is less informative), which is at http://www.pacificresearch.org/press/opd/2007/opd_07-04-20lm.html.
