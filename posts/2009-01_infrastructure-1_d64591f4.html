<h3>Infrastructure in a Stimulus Package-Becker</h3>
<p><br/>
Last week we blogged on how much stimulus to GDP and employment might be expected from a version of the Obama fiscal stimulus plan. I concluded that the amount of stimulus from the spending package would be far less than estimated in a study by the incoming Chairperson of the Council of Economic Advisers ("The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan", by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein, January 9, 2009). The activities stimulated by the package to a large extent would draw labor and capital away from other productive activities. In addition, the government programs were unlikely to be as well planned as the displaced private uses of these resources.</p>
<p>The stimulus package's plans for spending on "infrastructure" clearly illustrate both concerns. I put this word in quotation marks because of the many definitions of what is included in the concept of infrastructure.  Promoters of various stimulus packages- such as the just released House Committee on Appropriations $825 billion stimulus plan- include in infrastructure not only the traditional categories of roads, highways, harbors, and airports. They also include spending on broadband, school buildings, computers for school children, modern technologies, research and development, converter boxes for the transition to digital TV, phone service to rural areas, sewage treatment plants, computerized medical records and other health expenditures, and many other activities as well.</p>
<p>Some of this infrastructure spending may be very worthwhile-I return to this issue a bit later- but however merited, it is difficult to believe that they would provide much of a stimulus to the economy. Expansion of the health sector, for example, will add jobs to this sector, but it will do this mainly by drawing people into the health care sector who are presently employed in jobs outside this sector. This is because unemployment rates among health care workers are quite low, and most of the unemployed who had worked in construction, finance, or manufacturing are unlikely to qualify as health care workers without considerable additional training. This same conclusion applies to spending on expanding broadband, to make the energy used greener, to encourage new technologies and more research, and to improve teaching. </p>
<p>An analysis by Forbes publications of where most jobs will be created singles out engineering, accounting, nursing, and information technology, along with construction managers, computer-aided drafting specialists, and project managers. Unemployment rates among most of these specialists are not high. The rebuilding of "crumbling roads, bridges, and schools" highlighted by in various speeches by President Obama is likely to make greater use of unemployed workers in the construction sector. However, such spending will be a small fraction of the total stimulus package, and it is not easy for workers who helped build residential housing to shift to building highways.</p>
<p>A second crucial issue relates not to the amount of new output and employment created by the stimulus, but to the efficiency of the government spending. Efficiency is not likely to be high partly because of the fundamental conflict between the goal of stimulating employment and output in order to reduce the severity of the recession, and the goal of concentrating infrastructure spending on projects that add a lot of value to the economy. Stimulating the economy when employment is falling requires rapid spending of this huge stimulus package, but it is impossible for either the private or public sectors to spend effectively a large amount in a short time period since good spending takes a lot of planning time.</p>
<p>Putting new infrastructure spending in depressed areas like Detroit might have a big stimulating effect since infrastructure building projects in these areas can utilize some of the considerable unemployed resources there. However, many of these areas are also declining because they have been producing goods and services that are not in great demand, and will not be in demand in the future. Therefore, the overall value added by improving their roads and other infrastructure is likely to be a lot less than if the new infrastructure were located in growing areas that might have relatively little unemployment, but do have great demand for more roads, schools, and other types of long-term infrastructure. </p>
<p>Of course, at some point new taxes in some form have to be collected to pay for infrastructure and other stimulus spending. The sizable adverse effects on incentives of these taxes also have to be weighted against any value produced by the infrastructure (and other) stimulus spending.</p>
<p>The likelihood that such a rapid and large public spending program will be of low efficiency is compounded by political realities. Groups that have lots of political clout with Congress will get a disproportionate amount of the spending with only limited regard for the merits of the spending they advocate compared to alternative ways to spend the stimulus. The politically influential will also redefine various projects so that they can fall under the "infrastructure" rubric. A report called Ready to Go by the U.S. Conference of Mayors lists $73 billion worth of projects that they claim could be begun quickly. These projects include senior citizen centers, recreation facilities, and much other expenditure that are really private consumption items, many of dubious value, that the mayors call infrastructure spending.</p>
<p>Recessions would be a good time to increase infrastructure spending only if these projects can mainly utilize unemployed resources. This does not seem to be the case in most of the so-called infrastructure spending proposed under various stimulus plans.</p>

<p>I think that the any stimulus has to bring about a trade that probably would not happen outside of a crisis.</p>
<p>Here is my suggestion.</p>
<p>The Chinese government is expected to buy US Treasury Bills, to prop up their current holdings.</p>
<p>The Chinese cannot export goods to the US because nobody wants to buy crap anymore, and the Chinese in response produce even cheaper crap.</p>
<p>The Chinese don't have a regulatory system at their local levels worth crap and to institute such a system would cost a great deal of money, possibly something that could only be bought with US treasury bills.</p>
<p>Anybody see a deal here? </p>

<p>     I agree that the government should be careful to waste as little as they can, which, historically speaking seems unlikely.  I think though that you underestimate how much of the economy is dictated by the government at the moment.  In a choice between government spending and well regulated (so not health care, the military, banks, the stock market, schools or pretty much anything) private sector growth the private sector growth is likely to be more efficient, sustainable, and make people rich without them skimming off the government dime(agriculture atm).  Fortunately in my opinion we aren't in such a position, both our private and our public sector are grossly mismanaged.<br/>
     I think our country doesn't have to worry so much about where it's pulling the workers from, how about the unemployment rolls, and ya alot of them are probably going to need extensive retraining, are you suggesting that the government should subsidize their unmarketable skills to spare them the time and hassle of learning to do something useful?<br/>
     This isn't a downturn brought about by a short term liquidity crisis, the liquidity crisis is a symptom, and the root causes need to be addressed in a long term sustainable fashion.  Since the government also wants to help lower unemployment by tightening the labor market spending on broadband, school buildings, computers for school children, modern technologies, research and development, converter boxes for the transition to digital TV, phone service to rural areas, sewage treatment plants and computerized medical records seems just what the doctor ordered (other than the converter boxes).<br/>
     This is going to be ugly in the short haul and the long haul also.  I have no idea what is going to end up happening to the deficit either, the government appears to be having no trouble borrowing cash at low interest rates, but how long can that last?  How would the cost of the higher taxes to repay the debt compare with the nightmare of a debt holiday? Can you inflate it away? Ugly weirdness incoming, that's for sure.<br/>
     On the bright side Obama utilized the web brilliantly in his campaign, there is some hope I think that he can use the internet to greatly increase government accountability, which is the main benefit the private sector has traditionally held as I see it. </p>

<p>On stimulus for Detroit, you write "Putting new infrastructure spending in depressed areas like Detroit might have a big stimulating effect since infrastructure building projects in these areas can utilize some of the considerable unemployed resources there. However, many of these areas are also declining because they have been producing goods and services that are not in great demand, and will not be in demand in the future."</p>
<p>As a longtime resident of the Detroit area, I find this appalling on a moral level: we don't deserve help unless we can prove we're valuable?  On an economic level, it's a classic Catch-22.  Detroit does not deserve economic stimulus unless it produces things people want.  On the other hand, Detroit is unlikely to attract newer, more innovative businesses unless it can address its crumbling infrastructure, high crime, failing schools, and urban blight.  So where does that leave us?</p>

<p>Andrew:  I know very little about Detroit other than its history etc, and have been wondering about its potential second life.  With its geography it's easy to see why it was a power in the heavy steel and auto era, and today with the same plus freeways converging etc it would seem to have some natural advantages.  </p>
<p>But in mfg the plains and southern states are tough competitors, often "buying" factory placement with land and tax breaks.  </p>
<p>There's a good point in saying "no sense investing in declining areas" say a mining town that's "done" but I'd think there is still so much in Detroit that it's more of a turnaround proposition and up to local politics and the city fathers to have a regeneration plan that would justify its getting federal assistance.  There will surely be competition for what fed funds there are, and I take Obama at his word of trying to make every buck count. </p>
<p>Is there leadership there with a plan for the New Detroit?</p>

<p>I don't see how infrastructure spending can be used to stimulate the economy during all but the most protracted recessions.  It will take months to get the bill passed, still more months to plan these projects, more months to acquire land, choose contractors, order material and supplies, and when all of that is done, then they can hire the workers.  The likelihood that we will still be in a recession by that time seems very remote.  More likely, the project will draw off workers from overheated sectors of the economy, stoking inflation.  And when the projects are done, the workers will be laid off, just in time for the next recession.</p>

<p>C'mon guys, Grosse Point is doing just fine. Don't Diss Detroit simply because most of it's  Employers bailed out years ago and left the City holding the bag. Anyone with half a brain jumped ship as well and went elsewhere.</p>
<p>What are you're left with? Not much! Perhaps, we need not so much of an Urban Renewal Project, but more of an Urban Removal Project. Then we can start with a clean slate. Most major Cities across America are in the same fix. The infrastructure is so old, rotten, and toxic, lead and asbestos, not too mention, "brownfield" problems; it'll be cheaper and easier, to level, clean, and build anew.  </p>

<p>up until the point of serious deflation private lending institutions will view any deficit spending as predatory. should deficit spending under normal circumstances increase inflation the value of private lending institution assets shall decline. confronted with such a prospect they shall employ their resources to ensure congress does not pass any bills that authorize deficit spending of large magnatude.</p>
<p>the problem is compounded as of late as the cost to organizing for private financial institutions has declined as the industry has become more concentrated. this is a uniquely american problem as european countries chose to buy into private institutions rather than to bail them out, thus increasing the autonomy of the state.</p>
<p>in my opinion, the quandry on these boards assumes a level of state autonomy for the United States that is in conflict with reality; in general, very complex economic matters are handled by assuming away political implications.It would be most awesome if the Hoover institution would draw from its sizable repository of talent to add a political scientist to the becker posner blog.   </p>

<p>Dave: Almost everyone around today has is used to recessions being some brief nuisance like a speed bump in a parking lot; but my bet is this one is three or more years long, and even then, I'm concerned that we've some structural unemployment problem that will take a long time, if ever, to solve.

<p>Can someone please explain to me how the government which is broke and cannot spend anything without printing the money and which has a debt of 12 trillion dollars presently can possibly solve the economic malaise. Not to mention that economic theory, regardless of its proximity to truth, is completely distorted by political pettiness and manipulation. By the way, why were not the 2 million  at the inauguration at work? Maybe they thought that there would be a handout.</p>
<p>As to health care saving, there won't be any. The IT savings touted were based on a Rand study in 2005 which has become a fad concept pushed by politicians, vendors and the media. The Rand study was completely refuted by a Congressional Budget Office study in May 2008 and yet the politicians are still hawking the "savings". Why? The big vendors are charging physicians $50,000.00 per physician to install an office EHR system. Physicians won't spend that kind of money on a technology requiring space, personnel and constant maintenence. Think abaout it; Do you want your physician looking at a monitor and typing at a keyboard while you are trying to tell him/her about your chest pain. The UK National Health Service at the behest of Tony Blair tried to go electronic health record in 2004 and lost billions in that failure. It will now cost them three to four times as much for the redo if they had the money which they don't. There are better goals for the new people in Washington such as doing something about the 80 billion spent by Medicare each year in the last year of life. How about a mandatory advance directive at the time of social security registration. Everyone knows that there are vegetative patients kept alive in nursing homes so that families can keep getting the social security checks. Another big problem on the horizon is the looming shortage of good physicians and nurses.</p>

<p>The current government medical spending is unsustainable (and an open invitation for fraud), yet there seems to no effort to set limits (income and asset threshholds) for seniors on Medicare who can easily afford to pay their own way. Further, why should our Congressional millionaires receive top benefits paid for by a workforce, much of which are told that their small company offers no health plan? Medicaid is being drained by many young people (unemployed by choice feigning disabilities), who, frankly need a kick in the butt.  Makes no sense to me.</p>

<p>I'd like to comment on several of your observations regarding the relative impact of a public infrastructure stimulus package compared to a like amount of incentives for the private sector.  </p>
<p>First, what we're observing in the private sector by way of the the financial system bailout program is that the receipt of government capital is not creating additional economic activity on the part of these institutions.  Even if one takes into account labor market capacity issues in the occupations you've identified as being benefitted by the proposed government stimulus programs, at least this represents new and additional economic activity which will have a multiplier effect in the economy. </p>
<p>Secondly, you're also making an assumption that the resulting incremental additional deficits on the part of the federal government will not be offset by improved economic conditions which will increase tax revenues over what they would otherwise have been in the absence of this stimulus-driven activity.  This is not the key driver of future deficits.  Rather, the government needs to come up with a better approach to get entitlement/transfer program spending growth under control.</p>
<p>Finally, spending targeted at the specific industry I work in, health care, will produce near term tangible benefits if properly allocated.  There is considerable inefficiency here due to information issues which could be improved upon by facilitating an interoperable health care/medical record infrastructure.  Coupling this type of investment with incentives to increase the supply of primary and preventive care resources could provide a nice boost in worker productivity while helping to moderate future health care cost increases.</p>

<p>Jim; I'll try a few of these, but it sounds as though you're having a very bad day.</p>
<p>Can someone please explain to me how the government which is broke and cannot spend anything without printing the money and which has a debt of 12 trillion dollars presently can possibly solve the economic malaise.</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJJJJ  well that's a complex one, but I'd just comment that the US government is one of the few entities that can borrow very long term at pretty low rates of interest. That strikes me as being viable means of paying for long neglected infrastructure repairs and upgrades as well as providing some of the incentives to conserve energy we now waste as well as helping us contain more of our dollars HERE by spurring more energy alternatives.  Forget the past; we've been caught, again, flat footed and now is a good time to make the transition that various, earlier tax proposals, not passed, would have spurred over the intervening decades.</p>
<p>""Not to mention that economic theory, regardless of its proximity to truth, is completely distorted by political pettiness and manipulation. By the way, why were not the 2 million at the inauguration at work? Maybe they thought that there would be a handout."</p>
<p>JJJJ  Whew!  Let's see 600 private jets flew in, while Congress gave out 150,000 tickets that one suspects did not go to the unemployed, many came from nearby and while a lot of job benefits have disappeared, I think many still get a few vacation days per year.  I don't have much concern about six tenths of one percent of our population showing up for this historic event; aren't there about the same number sitting in sports stadiums fairly often?</p>
<p>""As to health care saving, there won't be any. The IT savings touted were based on a Rand study in 2005 which has become a fad concept pushed by politicians, vendors and the media. The Rand study was completely refuted by a Congressional Budget Office study in May 2008 and yet the politicians are still hawking the "savings". Why?""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJJ Not sure. I've always trusted CBO more than OMB which appears more politically driven  but would insurance and medical lobbyists have something to do with the variance?</p>
<p>"" The big vendors are charging physicians $50,000.00 per physician to install an office EHR system. Physicians won't spend that kind of money on a technology requiring space, personnel and constant maintenence.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJ My thought is that the horse and buggy days of so many individual cottage Doc shops is coming to an end.  Small banks figured out that they could not compete with new software that the bigs had and have been merging for a long time.  (I hope these efficiencies of scale are not confused with those "going rogue" and losing themselves along the way.)</p>
<p>"" Think abaout it; Do you want your physician looking at a monitor and typing at a keyboard while you are trying to tell him/her about your chest pain.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJ Well, I'm a VA patient, at times in AK and at others in OK.  So my experience is that of the physician in either place looking at my nearly complete record and asking ME about health issues. He/she then TYPES legible notes into MY record.  Then he reviews prescriptions taken, updates them w/ generating any cryptic notes on bits of paper which then go to the efficient fulfillment center where they're typically mailed to my home.  BTW they price shop too, paying just 40% of what the new Medicare D pays for the same thing.  </p>
<p><br/>
""The UK National Health Service at the behest of Tony Blair tried to go electronic health record in 2004 and lost billions in that failure. It will now cost them three to four times as much for the redo if they had the money which they don't.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJ Hmmmmmm perhaps the VA can pick up a few bucks selling copies of their system?  It really does work, and it's kind of reassuring that most of my med record is available in the states and abroad by typing in first letter of last name and last four SS digits.</p>
<p><br/>
""There are better goals for the new people in Washington such as doing something about the 80 billion spent by Medicare each year in the last year of life. How about a mandatory advance directive at the time of social security registration. Everyone knows that there are vegetative patients kept alive in nursing homes so that families can keep getting the social security checks.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJ Whew!  Truth is the SS of Medicaid patients in nursing homes goes into the pot with the rest. No advantage to family members. Kinda tough to know just when to pull the plug on your Dad or Mom.</p>
<p><br/>
 Another big problem on the horizon is the looming shortage of good physicians and nurses.</p>
<p>http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-03-02-doctor-shortage_x.htm</p>
<p>Of course the politicians won't be honest enough to tell the country up front that any national health system will require big time rationing which they know the public will not accept up front.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJJ Oh?  Currently we spend/waste 18% of GDP that is rapidly rising while the civilized nations are spending 8-12% of typically smaller GDP for universal health care. As for "rationing" I have LONG wondered what $10,000,000 CEO's of "insurance" companies bring to the party, or what benefit there is in court or other wrangling over who is covered or who gets the bill.  Yeah, I'd ration the hlll out of these wasteful overhead items.</p>
<p>""Needless to say, I am not optimistic and might have to adopt the old economic theory of gold under the mattress like some of my friends in Europe are doing.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJJ I thought you were something of a pessimist. Yup.</p>
<p>""Oh. I almost forgot to ask, where do you think I should put my mattress with the gold in it to best deal with the 20% inflation coming down the road when the wheelbarrows are full of worthless dollars.""</p>
<p>JJJJJJJJJ Well, at first we've the deflation to get through, and surely in the area of housing, stock or other ownership of most of our companies your mattress dollar is likely to buy more next week than this, but remember banks are backed by FDIC and are paying a smidgeon of interest as well.  </p>
<p>Inflationary times? Those of us "of a certain age" have lived much of our lives in them as the buck lost 90% of its value so at some point the traditional stores of productive RE, stocks, and a dab of gold or gold mines, and bonds that reflect the inflationary premium are the traditional hedges.  </p>
<p>Cheers and best of luck! Sorry there aren't any guarantees and that we HAVE been so hollowed out in the recent past, but in messes of the past it seems that if we do the "bright" thing at each turn we'll muddle through somehow.  Hope I've lessened your pessimism a bit, Jack <br/>

<p>Jack,</p>
<p>Hope you are right on all counts but I don't think so. Thanks for trying to cheer me up, though. Do you really think that the United States Government is going to cut the waste out of their health care budget? Good luck. And for those of us who have worked some in the VA system, no one holds it up as the model although I do have to give you that their EHR system is very, very good as is the military's. I would only point out that the rest of health care is not the military or the VA and might not respond well to a totalitarian approach.<br/>
Allow me to point out as well that most of the European healthcare systems are close to insolvency, there are VERY long waits for hospital care and in England there is no care for end stage renal disease(for example) if one is over 55 years. Talk about pulling the plug on mom and dad!!!</p>
<p>By the way, do you take anything to make yourself so happy or are you just an eternal optimist? </p>

<p>Jim:  Thanks! especially for being a good sport!  Just a follow up to say I don't think the Medicare (fee schedule) model is the ideal for the US.  </p>
<p>One thing about the VA model is that they're stuck with taking care of all eligible Vets, so I'd assume their mission statement is pretty simple; "take care of em and strive for efficiency and cost reduction".  Naturally that leaves the possibility, even likelihood of underserving, that is perhaps balanced by "the board" being elected representatives. </p>
<p>So I'm drawn to a model that might combine universality with some elements of competition to restrain costs.  Perhaps it's a bit like HMO's of today at which the consumer subscribes with their voucher.  I'd hope they'd compete on service? much as airlines used to before dereg, and that the consumer would have something like a "bill of rights" that would provide an outside opinion etc to avoid the rumored underservice of today's HMO's.</p>
<p>I'd expect we'd see bigger healthcare facilities than is typical today so as to more efficiently utilize costly MRI and Electronic Records but with consumer choice of primary physician etc.  </p>
<p>It's not easy to design what is best and probably especially tough with "pols" doing the designing! But I'm trying to get away from all the wrestling over a "procedure" cost schedule that can never be up to date or reward wholistic care over procedures.</p>
<p>  But, sometimes I joke about what a car or computer would cost if done under our current fee for service medical model with a door specialist,  followed by "a good transmission guy"  and finally another who "does paint" each with their own billing and malpractice insurance problems.  </p>
<p>Ha! but for now it looks like "they" are going to drive us all into the maw of "insurance" providers, but once we realize we're all in one big pool, and the costs are still running away, we will ask what $10 million insurance CEO's are providing, and for that matter what their whole paperwork nightmare provides.  If they want to be in the medical field they've plenty of retained earnings  could easily go into the healthcare provider side.  </p>
<p>I dunno.......... it's a shot!   </p>
<p>"By the way, do you take anything to make yourself so happy or are you just an eternal optimist?"</p>
<p>Well, much like Obama's speech and that of Clinton's I too would like to hope that "what's right with America outweighs what is wrong with  America" and that we've enough wealth and momentum to prevail, though we do have quite a "turnaround" task ahead of us.  </p>
<p>And........ speaking of matters renal, I'm happy that I'm well over 55 and still have one kidney left after a thrombosis shut one of them down, and politely picked an organ to shutdown that has a back up though it wasn't much fun at the time with the VA providing price-shopped coumadin and otherwise rather good health!  If you're a practitioner, know that while we may be frustrated at the delivery system that we're extremely appreciative of the docs, nurses and all! </p>

<p>Jack,</p>
<p>The link below will take you to, in my opinion, a useful study of the current European systems in some detail such that one gets a pretty good idea of what might work in the USA. My original reading took about two hours but it is well worth the time to dispell misconceptions about what is already out there.</p>
<p>http://www.euro.who.int/document/OBS/hcs8countries.pdf</p>
<p>In addition, below is a link to a review of Daniel Callahan's approach to health care rationing. You can delve deeper into Callahan's work by visiting the website for The Hastings Center, a prominent bioethics think tank founded by Callahan.</p>

<p>Jim... Thanks! I'm interested enough to slog through those but it'll take a while!  So far AUS seems to have the "advantage" that they dedicate about 8% of GDP so could solve some of their problems by dedicating a couple more percent as well as looking for more efficiencies. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, it seems that US industry  "downsized" and got rid of many middle managers, I suspect with help from even that era's computerization etc. but it seems to me that other than our great productive areas of farming and mfg that we've a LOT of built in bloat and inefficiencies.  Were we to honestly cut out a fair amount of fat GDP per capita would rise, wages SHOULD rise, and we'd have a much easier time paying for H/C, SS and caring for our elders.</p>

<p>.......... and "due diligence?"</p>
<p>Just last week, Bank of America announced that Merrill has suffered an unexpected loss of $1.79 billion for the fourth quarter of 2008, nearly collapsing BofA's purchase. Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis said that without $138 billion in government assistance, including the infusion of $20 billion from the federal government he would have pulled out of the Merrill deal, which was approved by BofA shareholders in early December.</p>
<p>Thain has come under pressure in recent weeks after several top executives at Merrill, including brokerage chief Bob McCann and investment banking head Greg Fleming, abruptly resigned from the firm citing differences with Thain. People close to Lewis say his relationship with Thain was further strained by the recent massive loss. Lewis himself has faced withering criticism for rushing the buy Merrill for $28 billion after less than two days of due diligence.</p>
