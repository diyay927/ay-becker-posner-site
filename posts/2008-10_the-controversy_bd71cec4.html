<h3>The Controversy over the Milton Friedman Institute--Posner</h3>
<p>Milton Friedman was one of the twentieth century's most distinguished economists, and one of the century's three economists (the other two being John Maynard Keynes and Friedrich Hayek) who had the greatest political influence--and he was the only American in the group. Friedman spent most of his career at the University of Chicago, so it is natural that the University should name a major new component of the University, devoted to economic research, after him. The Institute is essentially a joint venture of the University's economics department, graduate school of business, and law school. The use of his name will help the University raise the funds required for the new Institute.</p>
<p>The decision, announced five months ago, has generated controversy on the University campus, sharpened by the current economic crisis that is thought in some circles to have damaged Friedman's legacy (it has certainly damaged Alan Greenspan's legacy). Some 170 faculty members have signed a petition circulated by a Committee for Open Research on Economy and Society--which opposes the decision naming the new institute after Friedman--asking that a meeting of the University Senate (which consists of some University administrators and all faculty members who have been on the faculty for more than a year) be convened to discuss the decision. The stated ground of opposition is that naming the Institute after Friedman would constitute the University's endorsement of his political views and would bias the research conducted by the Institute in favor of the free-market ideology that Friedman promoted so strongly. But the opposition is also and probably primarily powered by distaste for Friedman's political and policy views and for his willingness to provide economic advice to the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. Friedman's association with policies that are either liberal or politically neutral, such as the volunteer army, the earned income tax credit (the negative income tax), the legalization of the laws against marijuana and other mind-altering drugs, and even affirmative action, is overlooked.</p>
<p>I don't think anyone would quarrel with the idea of an institute devoted to the support of academic research on economic issues, even though many of the issues that economists examine have political implications. The name is the focus of the controversy. Friedman was an advocate of politically controversial policies with which a number of University faculty do not want the University to be associated. When buildings, classrooms, institutes, schools, etc. in universities are named after someone, it is usually a donor. Especially when an institute, which is likely to be a special-purpose organization, is named after a public figure, it is natural to associate the mission of the organization with the name of that figure: the Hoover Institution of Stanford University was named after Herbert Hoover and is indeed conservative, though it is noteworthy that the Institution's conservative reputation has not extended to Stanford University as a whole, and no more would one expect the University of Chicago to be branded as conservative merely because it contains an institute named after a conservative economist. The University of Chicago is not a conservative institution, though it is not as monolithically liberal as its peer institutions.</p>
<p>The purpose of naming the new institute after Friedman was presumably to encourage fund-raising; one economics professor at the University has been quoted as saying that Friedman's name would "resonate with the donors." So a further worry is that most of the donors will be conservatives who support Friedman's political views (that is to say, his <em>conservative </em>political views, as many of his views were not conservative), and that the new Institute will perhaps unconsciously bias hiring and promotion in favor of economists who support those views. The Institute might (again, whether consciously or unconsciously), it is feared, conceive its mission as being to promote the ideas of the "Chicago School of Economics," of which Friedman was perhaps the leading (though not the founding), and certainly the most influential, member.</p>
<p>But that is unlikely. Economics is a highly competitive academic field, and piety toward distinguished predecessors is not the path to academic success. It is odd that the opponents of the Friedman naming should think that economists, of all people, would subordinate career motives to loyalty to Friedman's memory or the "Chicago School" (especially young economists for whom Friedman is just a name). If the religion professor who is leading the movement against the naming is right that "Friedman's over"--that the current economic crisis has consigned Friedman, along with Greenspan, to the dustbin of economic history--he should have no fear that the new Institute will be biased in favor of Friedman's views. If a physics institute were named after Albert Einstein, would the institute's researchers reject quantum theory?</p>
<p>It might seem that the controversy could be easily resolved by simply changing the name of the Institute. But that would be costly to the University in several respects. First, it would doubtless offend many donors, and probably leave the Institute in worse financial shape than had it not been named after Friedman in the first place. Second, it would weaken the University administration and encourage the encroachment by faculty on administration prerogatives. There is a whiff of the 1960s in the effort by faculty (joined by a number of students) to move the University of Chicago leftward. Even if the original naming of the Institute after Friedman was a mistake, there is now too much at stake for the University administration to back down. <br/>

<p>"Economics is a highly competitive field." Dear Judge, please name one that isn't highly competitive. Even in the disciplines which pay their PhDs much less than economics PhD's, there is a ferocious competition for any decent tenure track position. <br/>
Would anyone like to play devil's advocate for the Judge, who, I might assume, has a few cases to adjudicate?<br/>

<p>"What's in a Name"? I've never been a big fan of putting people's names on things and organizations. I much prefer a more descriptive title. Like, "The UofC Institute for Economic Research &amp; Development". But what do I know? There are hundreds if not thousands of Institutes named after people (not too mention streets and parks). Such as, Max Planck, Salk, Fermi, Pillsbury, Venter, Lerner, Cato?, Howard Hughes, Getty, Nestle, even including trees, Aspen, and tree seeds, Buckeye.</p>
<p>So what's in a Name? "Friedman" is just as good as anything. Especially, if it helps to raise funds for the organization's operating budget.   </p>

<p>  We live in a time in which certain groups move to erase names because they offend the politically correct zeitgeist, such as attempts to do away with things named after slaveholders George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  However, what's missing is context.  Today's hero could be, in a generation or two, not worthy of the honor (or vica versa).  The current controversy concerning Friedman is anything but contextual: opponents have seized upon recent Wall Street financial problems as a pretext for their 60's militancy, without regard for the position Friedman played in both academia and American life.  As such, their opposition is suspect and not worthy of consideration by the university.     </p>

<p>What person's name would not generate some sort of controversy?  All over academia, there is expressed distaste when it is proposed to name an endowed chair after someone who is distasteful to others.  It is as if University faculty are unaware that fundraising is the IV that sustains the lifeblood of their college.<br/>
That being said, I recall my first courses in Economics and the coursebooks authored by Prof. Friedman.  I thought 'who is this guy' and why is he trying to confuse me?  Give him a plaque or a lintel or classroom complex with his name, but an entire Institute?</p>

<p>For someone outside the academy this furor is hard to understand. Friedman's ideas will be  reevaluated by succeeding generations of economists who have the benefit of history including the current crisis. If his ideas do not stand the test of history he remains one of the most influential individuals ever associated with the UC. Robert E. Lee was wrong at Gettysburg and on the question of succession but his name is engraved on too many monuments and buildings to catalogue. The faculty would do well to stay out of this matter but it is a curious spectacle and a reminder of why serious people might want to avoid the faculty experience.</p>

<p>Posner frameworks the discussion in a way that although *au fait* in America, is bizarre globally. </p>
<p>It is simply untrue that universities are "monolithically liberal" unless it is possible to base a university on pre-enlightenment world-views.</p>
<p>Even the Catholic Church was incapable of this stunt, for its leading educational order, the Jesuits, had to make its peace with the enlightenment in order to do its job.</p>
<p>The University of Chicago gets its somewhat less than "monolithically" liberal reputation only because some of its faculty, and some of its bitter, twisted, and prematurely aged graduate students, will say paradoxical things which call into question the basic values of the Enlightenment such as fairness, decency, and an expanding as opposed to a contracting culture.</p>
<p>For example, a U of C math professor told Saul Bellow, who could for some strange reason never get a real job at the U of C despite winning a Nobel or two, that he didn't use the university library because he didn't read outside his field.</p>
<p>Comes now the Judge, Posner, who is also apt to say strikingly narrow and nasty things, either because he's engaged in high class trolling (which is bad) or actually believes them (which is worse).</p>

<p>This is a response to the comments by Sylvester: </p>
<p>It's not the competition for labor positions that is the issue here, but the competition of ideas. I do work related to public health where in that field there is no competition for ideas. In economics, there is healthy debate on issues of all types -- methodology, empirical outcomes, and policy. When I look at the public health area, i see that everyone agrees, especially on the policy implications (and so many people are really unnecessary). Milton Friedman would be the first person to support competition in the market place for ideas.</p>

Milton Friedman's alma mater, Rutgers University, has named more than one building, if memory serves, after Paul Robeson.

<p>Judge Posner, count me as one of the potential donors that you predict would be offended by the university taking Friedman's name off the institute.  Having faculty members like Friedman (and Becker and Posner) is what has induced me to contribute to the university for many years.</p>
<p>I thought the tiresome Pinochet business was dead and buried long ago, especially after Friedman explained it in great detail in <i>Two Lucky People</i>.  How naive I am!</p>
<p>I remember how Friedman used to have an open question and answer session once a year or so when I was a student there in the early 70's, a very politically charged time.  I remember one session in particular, when a group of SDS students turned up to shout him down.  Are they now UC faculty members?</p>
<p>I hope the university shows the same respect for its public that Friedman showed that night - he ignored the name-calling and answered the serious objections to his views with logic and his usual good-natured enthusiasm.  In this case, the logic is that the university is honoring a faculty member who arguably brought it more honor and presige throughout the world than any other in its history.</p>
<p>While I'm waltzing down memory lane, Mr. Becker, I'd like to add that Friedman was the best teacher I ever had too (I never had a course with you, though - my mistake!).</p>

<p>One additional thought that just occurred to me.  I once heard Friedman say that universities sell two products, education and monuments, the latter being the professorships, buildings and schools named after contributors.  I believe he would feel very honored that in this case the university is giving away a very big monument - if, that is, the administration has the guts to stand its ground.         </p>

<p>One has to be wary of monuments and the power to erect them as Shelley wrote in his poem Ozymandias:</p>
<p>I met a traveller from an antique land<br/>
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand,<br/>
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown<br/>
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command<br/>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.<br/>
And on the pedestal these words appear:<br/>
`My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings:<br/>
Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!'<br/>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,<br/>

<p>Excellent point Jim! Also, institutions that survive long enough seem to eventually evolve into  something diametrically opposed to their founders.  Mainstream religions have certainly evolved with the times. I am sure that the catholic church, if it survives will eventually embrace atheism as the "true" message. </p>

<p>It's sad that every naming has to be so politically controversial or economically motivated. Also sad that so many people get upset over the name of the institute. If it was the Karl Marx institute  than the outrage would be justified. </p>

<p> US-Bankensektor:<br/>
von Raivo Pommer-Eesti-raimo1@hot.ee</p>
<p> Die Finanzkrise treibt die einst weltgrÃ¶Ãte Bank Citigroup in die Arme des Staates. Angesichts neuer Ã¼berraschender MilliardenlÃ¶cher wird der taumelnde Finanzriese teilverstaatlicht. Die US-Regierung weitet ihren Anteil als kÃ¼nftig grÃ¶Ãter AktionÃ¤r auf bis zu 36 Prozent aus.</p>
<p>Die MÃ¤rkte reagierten am Freitag auf den historischen Schritt in der US-Bankenbranche mit Entsetzen: Die Citi-Aktie stÃ¼rzte fast ins Bodenlose und riss die MÃ¤rkte weltweit mit. Der Eingriff des Staates heizte die Spekulationen weiter an, welches US-Institut als nÃ¤chstes womÃ¶glich sogar komplett von der Regierung Ã¼bernommen werden kÃ¶nnte.</p>
<p>Die Krise der Citigroup beschleunigte sich nochmals dramatisch: FÃ¼r 2008 gab sie am Freitag Ã¼berraschend neue Wertberichtigungen von 9,6 Milliarden Dollar (7,5 Mrd Euro) vor Steuern bekannt. Damit liegt der Rekordverlust fÃ¼r das vergangene Jahr mit nun 27,7 Milliarden Dollar noch einmal um knapp die HÃ¤lfte hÃ¶her als kÃ¼rzlich verkÃ¼ndet. Schon bisher zÃ¤hlte die Bank zu den weltweit grÃ¶Ãten Verlierern der Finanzkrise.</p>

<p>ABS: what's incoherent? Fairness and decency? Well, since you posted, I think we've (1) had an election for fairness and decency and (2) a stunning proof of what excessive narrowness, and coherence bought at the price of truth, can lead us in the credit crisis.</p>
<p>I think, ABS, that the liberal professors would not even propose a Milton Keynes institute. However, if they did so, it would be on the basis that Keynes, unlike the monetarist Friedman, has not been thoroughly discredited. </p>

<p>The fact that the "dismal science" is not a science is proven by the fact that while you have a Max Planck Institute, and you could have an Al Einstein Institute, you could not have an Adam Smith Institute or a Karl Marx Institute without announcing committments to ideology outside of your discipline.</p>
<p>Therefore, economists would be well-advised not to wash this particular piece of very dirty laundry in public.</p>
<p>Einstein's results work outside of history no matter what. Friedman's don't, and what's more, he didn't claim they did; Friedman merely noticed that in 1981, screwing around with the money supply could produce a mini-depression and Whip Inflation Then. But now, doing so is pushing on a string. </p>
<p>Keynes failed to anticipate that redistribution would be gamed in a mixed capitalist/socialist economy so as to impoverish the socialist part, since in their role as capitalist actors, people would naturally exploit the socialism (working as well as collection welfare, for example). </p>
<p>Keynes failed to anticipate British "bloody-mindedness": the drive by union members to maximize their pay packets in a society in which the greengrocer and the landlord had to be paid, and in which National Health was being cut back.</p>
<p>Hayek foresaw this and announced as a General Law that planning an economy would never work, for two reasons: (1) the costs of coordination would overwhelm the planners in all cases and (2) coordination would be gamed, even in a pure socialist economy, in self-interest.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, Hayek, with an Austrian school excess respect for brute facts, was unable to prove (1) or (2). (1) may have been a result of the primitive state of office technology in his day and no "proof" of (2) exists: in fact, counterexamples exist, such as Lancashire weavers supporting the North in the American Civil War.</p>
<p>Whereas Marx made the claim that over history, productive forces would evolve, and may yet be right. He'd deserve a Karl Marx Institute were he so.</p>
<p>A Milton Friedman Skewl of Economix is ideological, as ideological as a Marx undt Engels Hochschule fur der Sozial-Forschung. Best to give economics institutes neutral names, or even cute names (Hello Kitty Institute) until you boys figure it all out.</p>

<p>i dont see why they should back down, they've done nothing wrong and a hell of a lot of history and tradition to stand by,although we all evolve and adapt there is the brand name to consider and i think it would be a loss to change this, when the arguments would disapear with time.</p>

<p>In terms of impact, Milton Friedman was no less influential than Karl Marx of the last century.</p>
<p>But, in terms of human progress, neither can be idolized for their aptitude in converting human capital into profits, since neither approached economy from a localized perspective as to what was best for the ordinary man on the street, the backbone of life, and how progress and innovation either helps to create greater opportunity, or preserves traditional values of enterprise.</p>
<p>From that perspective, both were extremists, helping to justify to management the utilitarian motive in economics without giving just credibility to the purpose of humankind and how human society is optimized vs utilized.</p>
