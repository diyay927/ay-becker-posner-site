<p class="MsoNormal">Bubbles in prices of stocks, houses, or other assets are
usually defined to mean sizable and somewhat prolonged deviations in these
prices from the fundamental determinants of the prices. These price deviations
are supposed to get larger and larger until the bubble bursts, and then price
rather abruptly go back close to the levels expected from fundamentals. Do
bubbles so defined exist? I believe they do, although I applaud economists who
work hard to find explanations of such price movements in more subtle changes
in fundamentals. But we do not have good explanations for when bubbles
arise and when they end.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Bubbles depend on expectations that get out of whack and
become self-fulfilling for a while. In recent years, one of the most glaring
examples of what appears to be a bubble is the pricing of young Internet and
biotech companies during the period 1995-2000. Many companies in these fields
that had no earnings or even any sales, and objectively had little prospects of
earning anything in the reasonable future, were deluged with money from venture
capitalists and others. Their stocks if they went public had enormous market
values relative to any likely discounted earnings. After a few years the market
realized the folly of what had been happening, the bubble burst, values came
back to earth, and most of these companies went out of business.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The boom in housing prices in the United States that started
in the late 1990s, and peaked in 2006, is another example of what looks like a
bubble. According to data that Karl Case and Robert Shiller compiled, real
housing prices in the United States went up on average by about 10% a year for
six or seven years, and then crashed after 2006 to erase much of the previous
gain. Neither increases in construction costs nor in overall population levels,
two major fundamental determinants of housing prices, appear capable of
explaining these price movements. Some of the price rise is surely explained by
low interest rates on mortgages and low down payment requirements, but part of
the bubble mentality was the willingness of lenders to give ridiculously
generous terms to many buyers who had little ability to withstand any even
moderate shocks to their economic circumstances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The most plausible view of asset price bubbles is that the
price increases of an asset are supported by expectations of even further price
increases that makes it worthwhile to buy and hold the asset at prices that far
exceed the prices determined by the fundamentals. A sophisticated and
attractive version of this argument is that social interactions produce large
and cumulative changes in prices from modest initiating forces. It is well
known in social interaction theory (see, for example, the book Social Economics
by Gary Becker and Kevin Murphy) that a “social multiplier” can magnify small
initial changes in demand for a good or asset into large changes in prices or
consumption.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">According to this argument, suppose a “few” participants in
say the housing market begin to expect significant price appreciation, perhaps
due to low interest rates. Their expectations then influence the expectations
of others through a “contagion” or social interaction, process. As more and
more persons expect housing prices to rise, this leads to expectations of even
greater housing price increases, and a bubble in housing prices starts. The
bubble would end when expectations about price increases become even a little
pessimistic since then price levels would seem much too high, and price
decline expectations could spread through the populations. Prices may then fall
abruptly to earth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although I find a social interaction approach to bubbles
appealing, it does run into several difficulties. Why do not enough savvy
investors see through what is going on, and build up large short
positions. These short holdings would prevent a bubble from getting out of hand because they in effect
increases the supply of the asset to help offset much of the unrealistic
increase in demand? Some investors like John Paulson did take short positions
in the residential housing market and made fortunes, as this theory would
predict, although Paulson did it very indirectly through mortgage-backed
securities and swaps. However, papers in finance point out that in many asset
markets it is difficult to take large short positions on the future prices of
these assets. Such difficulties would limit how much short arbitrage occurs
(see the classic paper by Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny “the Limits of
Arbitrage”, Journal of Finance, 1997).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, if only small initial shocks are required because
of the magnification produced by social interactions, why do not bubbles occur
even more frequently in markets like housing? The national housing indexes that
Case and Shiller compiled show only a few episodes over the past century when
major deviations from fundamentals occurred at the national level-the Florida
land boom of the 1920s was a local, or at most a regional, phenomena. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moreover, if the social interactions explanation is right,
bubbles should also happen in a downward direction, so that prices could
continue to fall <strong>below</strong> levels
justified by fundamentals. National housing prices have basically never been
significantly below levels expected from construction costs and other
fundamentals. Prices below fundamentals have persisted for years in declining
cities, as Edward Glaeser of Harvard has shown, but these are not examples of
bubbles. Rather, they reflect the slowness in the rate of depreciation in the
excess housing found in declining cities. Perhaps downward bubbles are
generally less common because it is easier to take long rather than short
positions, so that arbitragers can more easily buy assets in sufficient
quantities to keep prices from falling too much below the fundamental
determinants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If only small initiating and terminating forces are needed
for bubbles to start and end, then it is easy to understand why bubbles occur,
and why the start and end of bubbles are so difficult to predict, either by
market participants or government officials. Some economists have suggested
recently- discussed in the May 8 issue of The Economist- that governments try
to take actions, such as countercyclical taxes on real estate, that prevent
bubbles, in particular housing bubbles, from getting out of hand. The papers
The Economist cited appear to misuse the “externality” argument for
government actions in the housing market, but in addition I am highly skeptical
that government officials can succeed where profit-seeking market participants
fail. At least in the US, the vast majority of government officials involved
encouraged rather than tried to moderate the housing bubble. I believe the best
contribution public policy can make to the control of bubbles is to follow
steady well-defined rules of behavior, such as Taylor-type rules, or capital
requirement rules, that at least prevent political pressures from exacerbating
any bubbles that do develop in housing and other markets.</p>
