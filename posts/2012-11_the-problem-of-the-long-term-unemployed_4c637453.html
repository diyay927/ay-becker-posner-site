<p>It is straightforward to enumerate bad effects of being<br/>unemployed for a long time, such as erosion of skills, loss of contacts, and<br/>reluctance of employers to hire a person who has been unemployed for a long<br/>time (this is because employers often use a person’s having been unemployed for<br/>a long time as a signal of lack of commitment to or fitness for employment).<br/>But it is difficult to make a precise estimate of the gravity of the problem. </p>
<p>For one thing, there is no nonarbitrary definition of “long<br/>term.” Is it six months? (Many women are out of the work force for longer<br/>because they have young children, yet do find jobs when they return, albeit<br/>often at a lower wage than if they had remained in the labor force continuously.)<br/>A year? One would have to know the average rate at which job skills erode,<br/>contacts diminish, or potential employers’ suspicions grow, to be able to determine<br/>the economically meaningful cut off. </p>
<p>And even if this hurdle could be surmounted, it is unclear<br/>who actually is “unemployed” and who simply has left the work force (retired<br/>early, become a housewife or house husband and thus substituted household<br/>production for paid work, become disabled, or interrupted work to go to college<br/>or to a professional school). The number of people who are unemployed in the<br/>Bureau of Labor Statistics sense—not employed at present, but looking for<br/>work—understates the number of long-term unemployed, because some of the<br/>long-term unemployed have become discouraged, ceased looking for work, and thus<br/>are no longer counted as unemployed. No one knows for sure how many such<br/>discouraged workers there are, but the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates<br/>that there currently are 800,000 id rgwn. This actually is rather few relative<br/>to the 5 million long-term unemployed, that is, unemployed who are still<br/>looking for work. </p>
<p>Notice too that people who leaves the labor force are not<br/>necessarily unemployed in an economic sense. Household production is real.<br/>Apart from the obvious examples, a person who retires early to help with<br/>raising a grandchild, thus freeing up the parents to devote more time to paid<br/>work, is productively though not formally employed. This is true even if the<br/>person is still looking for a paid job, and regards his stint as a household<br/>producer as temporary. The difficulty of valuing the household production of<br/>the long-term unemployed makes the cost of long-term unemployment to the<br/>economy difficult to assess, although it is certainly positive. </p>
<p>A final problem in estimating the social costs of long-term<br/>unemployment is measuring the long term. Here one should distinguish between<br/>long-term unemployed in the BLS sense—unemployed for a long time but still<br/>looking for work—and unemployed who have stopped looking for work, whom the BLS<br/>as I said calls discouraged workers. The unemployment rate in the United States<br/>was very high throughout the 1930s, and many of the unemployed must have been<br/>unemployed for years, yet that doesn’t seem to have left a residue of discouraged,<br/>prematurely retired workers. Eventually most of them must have found jobs, and<br/>not just during the World War II labor shortage, since low unemployment<br/>persisted after the war ended. Surprisingly, of the 5 million long-term<br/>unemployed still looking for jobs today, 1.7 million have been unemployed for<br/>more than 99 weeks—and they are still looking. As the economy continues to<br/>recover, assuming it does so, more will look for—and find—jobs. According to<br/>the latest BLS statistics, in the past year the number of discouraged workers<br/>has dropped by 16 percent, from 967,000 to 813,000. That is a promising sign. </p>
<p>Long-term unemployment may turn out not to have a long-term<br/>effect on the economy. Or may—for even though the economy has improved over the<br/>past year, the number of long-term unemployed (the 5 million) has not declined.<br/>This may reflect a reduced demand for workers, because of automation and (as<br/>Becker points out) decline of manufacturing, which are economic changes<br/>independent, or largely so, of the depressed state of the U.S. economy as<br/>a whole.</p>
