<p class="MsoNormal">Are the Democratic-controlled Congress and President Obama
very much pro union? Unquestionably. Do the economic effects of unions on the
welfare of workers as a whole justify that union bias? No. Has their pro-union
orientation seriously retarded the recovery from the recession? Probably. The
following discussion tries to justify these answers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The pro-union orientation has been demonstrated in many
ways. Posner gives a few examples, and I will add some more. The automobile
industry would not have been bailed out so generously were it not for the
political power of the United Auto Workers. The alternative would likely have
been bankruptcy without a federal bailout, which I favored. Bankruptcy without
government involvement would have cut health and other fringe benefits of
autoworkers more sharply, and might have led to more plant closings in the
industry. It would also, however, have led to a more robust recovery of the
surviving American auto companies, and possibly even in the longer run raised
employment in auto plants located not in the South because wages and fringe
benefits would then have been lower at these plants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">An important example this past week offers another
illustration of the pro union orientation. For the first time the US has cited
for labor violations a country, Guatemala, that is a free trade partner with
the US. That the American government has the presumption to interfere in the
labor policies of another country is disturbing in itself. All commentators
agree, however, that it was done at the urging of American unions. This was
likely an attempt to reduce the competition of goods and
services from Guatemala and especially from other free trade partners-such as
Mexico-for goods made by unionized American companies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Congress tried to pass, and President Obama supported, The
Employee Free Choice Act to eliminate private elections for union
certification. Fortunately, enough moderate Democrats and Republicans have been
able to beat back these proposals, and they have been shelved, perhaps only
temporarily.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Economists distinguish competitive from monopoly unions. A
competitive union system, like Japan’s, has unions at companies when the
employees of these companies prefer to bargain collectively. However,
competitive unionism does not allow a single union to control the majority of
companies in the same industry, which is monopoly unionism. The US typically
has monopoly unions, such as the steelworkers union, autoworkers union, or
service workers union, but a long time ago the Clayton Act of 1914 explicitly
exempted unions from anti-trust laws under most circumstances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Monopoly unions do tend to raise the earnings and fringe
benefits of workers in the industries where they exist. This is seen from the
ridiculously high fringe benefits that the United Auto Workers unions squeezed
out of American auto companies during the days when they were profitable but
not well managed. Higher union earnings come partly at the expense of the
profits of the industries unionized, but also at the expense of lower
employment than would have occurred with more competitive wages and other
benefits. The prospective employees priced out of jobs in unionized sectors
seek employment in other sectors, which lowers the earnings of workers in these
latter sectors. The net effect is a misallocation of labor compared to an
efficient allocation, and possibly even a reduction in the income received by
workers as a whole, including workers in the non-union sectors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">During this recession, wages did fall for many workers, but
mainly among non-union workers. A telling example is what happened at many
state and local governments that are in serious fiscal difficulties. Since
wages of their union workers have been set by contract, they were forced
primarily to cut wages of administrative staff and other non-union employees.
For example, the state of Illinois has the largest fiscal deficit as a percent
of its budget of any state. It required many of its high level non-union employees
to take 24 unpaid leave days, or about a 9% cut in their salaries, since the
state government cannot touch the wages of their many unionized employees.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As Posner indicates, only about 7% of all non-government
American workers are unionized, compared to over 35% of workers at federal,
state, and local governments. During the past 40 years, the fraction of
unionized civilian workers fell steeply-and not only in the United States- while
the unionization of government workers fell only a little. It
might seem unlikely that workers which comprise only about15% of the total labor
force would have a major effect on the speed of the recovery from the
recession.<span>  </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The real threat to a robust recovery on the labor side has
come from employer and entrepreneurial fears that once the economic environment
improves, a Democratic Congress and administration will pass pro-union and
other pro-worker legislation that will raise the cost of doing business and cut
profits. In this way the obvious pro-union-pro-worker bias of the present
government has contributed to a slower recovery, especially in labor markets.
This helps explain the depressingly slow decline in unemployment rates and in
the number of workers who have given up looking for jobs.</p>
