<h3>Should Genetic Testing Be Forbidden?--Posner</h3>
<p>Congress is on the verge of passing a bill that will forbid employers to discriminate against employees (including applicants for employments) on the basis of the results of genetic tests, and forbid health insurers to deny insurance or charge higher premiums on the basis of such results. (Actually, the bill tightens up an existing law that was designed to do the same things but turned out to have loopholes.) The stated rationale of the bill is that it will encourage people to obtain such tests and use the results to seek treatment or make other decisions, such as deciding whether to have children. That rationale is dubious for several reasons. First, people who suspect they have a gene that causes or predisposes them to a serious disease have a strong incentive to be tested (especially if there are treatment options), an incentive that will often override the possible adverse effect of a positive test result on employment or insurance. Second, in the absence of the law, employers and insurers could make such testing a condition of employment or insurance. Third, persons who are confident that they do not have a genetic defect have an incentive to test voluntarily and disclose their negative results to employers or insurers--and some of these persons will be mistaken and discover that they indeed have such a defect.</p>
<p>So while some people are doubtless deterred from testing by concern with the effect on their employability or insurability, on balance it is unlikely that there will be more testing by virtue of the new law. In a strict efficiency analysis, moreover, even if more people who are likely to have genetic defects will test for them as a result of the law, this would not necessarily be an argument in favor of the law. There is no increase in efficiency when a person conceals information (or avoids obtaining information that he fears he would have to try conceal if he did obtain it) in order to obtain a benefit that he would not obtain if he disclosed it. This would be obvious if a person who knew he was deathly ill bought a huge life insurance policy, concealing his illness from the insurer. The situation is no different if the person knows he may be deathly ill and decides not to verify his suspicion lest the confirmation of it prevent him from obtaining the insurance policy. In either case he is shifting his own expected costs (whether reduced longevity or medical expenses) to unconsenting others.</p>
<p>Analysis is complicated, however, by the possibility that a failure to test brought about by fear of the consequences for insurance or employment would impose costs on other people. That would happen if a prompt diagnosis would enable treatment of a genetic defect at a lower cost, assuming that treatment expenses are paid for in part at least by third parties. Then those third parties would be better off if the person tested. Suppose for example that had the person tested positive, she would not have had a child; instead she had the child, and it is badly deformed, requiring enormous medical expenses paid largely by third parties.</p>
<p>That would be a genuine externality, whereas if the cost of a medical treatment is merely shifted from the individual to his employer or insurer (which means, of course, to the other insureds of this insurer), the externality would be merely pecuniary. That is, it would be merely a transfer of wealth rather than an avoidable investment of scarce resources, as in the example just given where a medical expense is incurred that would not have been incurred had it not been for the failure to test. But transfers often and here are likely to have such effects, and not merely to alter the distribution of wealth. The cost of health insurance will rise if the new law goes into effect, and that rise will increase the number of persons who do not have health insurance, and their lack of insurance coverage may cause them to forgo tests and treatments that may, just as when a genetic test is forgone, avoid costlier treatments and other adverse consequences later on. Employers' labor costs will rise too, resulting in lower net wages; and health is positively correlated with income, so again the transfer will have secondary effects in the form of more ill health.</p>
<p>So even if the new law led to more genetic testing--which probably it would not do, for the reasons stated at the outset--its social costs, from the standpoint of economic efficiency, would probably be negative.</p>
<p>The law might seem defensible on noneconomic grounds as a form of social insurance, since persons who test positive for genetic defects may be unable to obtain private health insurance. The broader point is that the more that science reduces uncertainty about individuals' health, the less risk pooling there will be and the greater, therefore, the demand for social insurance. In the limit, if everyone's health prospects were known with certainty, there would be no market for health insurance at all and this would exacerbate the effects of differential health on equality of wealth; no longer would the healthy be paying to insure the unhealthy.</p>
<p>If social insurance is desired, the question becomes whether to finance it through taxes or, as under the proposed law, to compel private industry to provide it. The major difference is the identity of the "taxpayers": it is federal taxpayers in the first case and the members of the private insurers' insurance pools in the second. The allocative effects of the social insurance "tax" will differ because higher income taxes do not have the same behavioral effects as higher health-insurance premiums. The higher premiums cause people to leave the insurance pool; given current political concerns with the number of people who do not have health insurance, placing the "tax" on those who do have such insurance is questionable.</p>
<p>Eighty percent of Americans tell pollsters that they do not think that health insurers should be allowed to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with genetic defects. This is an example of Americans' economic illiteracy.<br/>

<p>The post excellently describes the increased desirability of social insurance in cases of increased scientific certainty and less risk pooling. As to the question who should provide such insurance, I think the answer is obvious. As much as I dislike entitlement programs [or, as they should be known, welfare] I feel like "social" insurance should be paid for by "society," or in this case the taxpayers. Such insurance would essentially be mandatory risk pooling, which I'd much rather impose on those mandating the pooling rather than unwilling insurers or employers. I do think such steps are increasingly necessary, especially when it comes to genetic defects and hereditary conditions, because I find it difficult to make people responsible for things they did not cause in the least. [I know that's been the case for all of human history. I'd like to see some progress made.]</p>

<p>I think so many Americans support this not out of economic illiteracy so much as political realism -- during this transition phase as genetic testing becomes better at predicting health outcomes, it will be decades before the political system can effectively socialize the cost of medical care.</p>

<p>I like the argument for genetic testing because of the reasoning that more people would be able to detect illnesses earlier and thus receive cheaper treatment. It could sound like an idealistic statement where utility is maximised.</p>
<p>In Australia, we either pay Medicare levy or we receive a rebate from the government if we take up health insurance therefore everyone that pays taxes is contributing in some form. As mentioned by Haris, due to the fact that men have no control over genetic it is only fair that the government steps in to help out. I donât necessarily think that if one tests negative for defects then one would not want insurance. I have little scientific background bar my high school science classes but what if people are insuring against illnesses that have a low probability of occurring, perhaps some kind of dormant disease that could be triggered by our decadent lifestyle. If this assumption is invalid then my following suggestion shall end here. Otherwise the following is what I think could happen.</p>
<p>Insurance is built upon people's averseness to the small probability of something disastrous happening, so I don't see why the above would be too farfetched. Private insurance can fluorish alongside social insurance if genetic testing is made compulsory for purchasing health insurance. What could possibly happen is that the private insurer would consist of customers who have non-genetic defects only and social insurance consisting of those with genetic defects. Based on this hypothesis, private insurance would make a higher profit margin. Yes, we can argue that premiums paid by those with non-genetic defects would be drastically lower however I would say not by too much because people are paying for the service and efficiency of a private insurer. A portion of the higher profits resulting from this effect would then be taxed by the government and allocated specifically to the social insurer to help those test positive on genetic defect. The premiums paid by those who test positive will then be lowered from this subsidy.<br/>
The effect of this will be that illnesses will be detected earlier as people are more willing to be tested and cured at a cheaper rate. This also eliminates unnecessary spending of resources by those test positive to cheat their insurer. Perhaps one unfairness is that those who test positive with genetic defects will have to be patient and bear with the bureaucracy of a social insurer. <br/>
Lifeâs unfairness, Iâll leave that to God â¦<br/>

<p>If we as a nation were taxed in order to provide health insurance to those rendered uninsurable by the presence of genetic defects, does anyone really believe those tax dollars would be spent efficiently?</p>
<p>The Washington post article from earlier today suggests that we aren't even providing acceptable care to our soldiers at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center let alone to Joe Schmo from Peoria when it turns out he might have ALS. </p>
<p>The notion that the government is going (VROOM!) spring into action and put together a decent and efficient public health care system for the uninsurable is beyond the level of a pipe dream.  I doubt politicians would even agree to the tax increase needed to fund such a system, let alone that it would be well run.<br/>

<p>This issue clearly shows that the Congress still believes in the concept of private insurance supplied by employers. It's just an attempt to minimize cost cutting and maximizing margins by these two groups by using genetic testing. Which they will do if not stopped by legislation. It's quite rational, given the system that is now in place in this country. Otherwise, radical and revolutionary changes would have to take place within the health care industry and society as a whole. Which I don't think is one bridge Congress is quite ready to cross. And as such, functions as a band-aid on an already worn out and antiquated system (health insurance that is). </p>
<p>I won't even get into the issues of potential "wrongful death" and other related tort issues that might come up if an individual dies because of lack of medical care or the necessities of life due to denial of health insurance or employment due to genetic testing. </p>

<p>Haris:</p>
<p>I think there is a question of government efficiency that needs to be asked.  I accept that forcing private insurers to provide coverage is inefficient, but I am not sure if it is any more inefficient than government coverage.</p>
<p>You say that government coverage may be the only option left, but I ask whether it's really any better than the option against which Posner argues.  </p>
<p>If nothing else, the present option has the benefit of taking effect immediately.  No one has to lose their coverage waiting for Congress to act to set up a national insurance program.  If you or Posner believe that a federal system would be better, then why not view the present laws as a "stop gap" and urge your congressmen to set up such a taxpayer funded program?  Once established, the existing burden can be lifted from insurers.  (One possible answer to the previous question, of course, is that Congress is so inefficient that you do not believe it could set up a national insurance program unless "forced" to do so by a massive healthcare crisis.  Then the question becomes whether it's better to suffer through such a crisis or through the the insurer-burdened system.)</p>
<p>In my view, the system of oversight of insurance companies by each of the States individually is already so inefficient that (if you really want to save the insurance companies from the scourge of economic illiteracy) redesigning that system into a single federal program, rather than 50 different State Insurance Commissioners, is probably a better target.</p>

<p>Well this one's simple as both Posner and Becker demonstrate they've "bought" the whole corporate packet.  Posner's dismissal of the "80% of Americans" as being economically illiterate has me wondering about his own "literacy".  </p>
<p>For openers, where is the "economic efficiency" of being required to reveal "known" genetic "flaws" or pre-existing conditions" while those remaining, by choice, ignorant of their "flaws" by opting not to take the test they might desire to take until they are safely "in the pool?" </p>
<p>Second, doesn't this bring up the question of just what "insurance" and "risk pools" are about in the first place?  For example with an apparently healthy set of kids, why would we pay out a pricey premium to an "insurer" and kick in our share of the CEO's multi-million buck salary?  Of course THE answer is that of the RISK  that one of the kids does develop leukemia or some other crushingly expensive disease.  </p>
<p>Obviously, there is the "adverse selection" problem, but how long are we going to prop up this  massively expensive and cumbersome system that is not serving us well and LET "Them" cherry pick their most profitable sets of clients? Or play "gotcha" games with the middle aged who change jobs or otherwise get caught outside "the pool" with uninsurable "pre-existing" conditions?? And why do "conservative economists" gloss over the market distortion effects of trapped at a company  due to a pre-existing and now uninsurable, "condition" or even denying their talents to small business start-ups because they have families and  can not work where there are not "health care benefits?"  </p>
<p>There is really ONLY one way around this mess, and that is a system where all are in the pool. You can design the rest of the medical payments system around the pool in a number of ways, but I see no alternative to all being in the pool where the small costs of the young and healthy do contribute to those unfortunate to have a costly illness in their youth.  That is what a risk pool is all about and were the costs not as horrendous as our system creates, why would anyone NOT want to be in a shared risk pool? </p>
<p>In regard to the predictably higher costs of older folk our current system of,  some are in, some are out, some are "Medicare" "VA" or "Medicaid" patients does not save any money nor does it apply any "free market" cost lower effect. Instead, it simple adds on the very substantial insurance company overhead, the clerical costs of sorting out "coverage" as well as the costs of forgoing rational preventative care and finally the costs of litigation as to "who's bill" and with medical costs being our Number One cause of bankruptcy a substantial part of our court administration costs. </p>
<p>If the above is not enough, what system do you suggest as we know we'll change jobs frequently in the "new economy" and that jobs with "benefits" are becoming less common?  If you suggest some silly "health savings account" or "shopping for a good deal" would you please include some figures showing how those living in households below the $45,000 median income can play your game or cope with a major illness?  Or, if leaving the sick  to show up half-dead for the priciest care on the planet and clogging up or ER's would you so state?</p>

<p>......... As I see the amount of added value contributed by "insurance" companies to be a very small fraction of what they add in overhead, I'd go a step further and have the government collect the funds.  They've been very efficient in this role in SS and Medicare.  Today's "insurance" companies?  They COULD go to work for a living, say using their claims expertise and huge pools of capital to form competing HMO's, PPO's and other forms of service providers, instead of continuing to be the parasites that have grown so large they're killing their host. </p>
<p>How to connect the dots? I end up with corporations pitching in an amount similar to their current participation and filling the gap with taxes.  Then all citizens would have a coupon, or better, a "smart card" with which to shop the various alternatives.  </p>
<p>Cherry picking? Uh-uh, the PEOPLE would be a the table to design the coverage contract and as we'd ALL be in the pool they'd not be allowed to exclude "genetic flaws" or pre-existing conditions, but could provide some small incentives for non-smokers etc. </p>
<p>Something like that?  Jack</p>

<p>I disagree that these poll numbers are the result of "economic illiteracy."  I think the explanation is simpler:  people do not believe that it is "just" to deny health insurance based on a genetic defect.  They realize that, since the U.S. does not have universal health care, denial of private insurance effectively means denial of care.  I would wager that the same 80% would agree with Posner that there is no problem in denying life insurance (as opposed to health insurance) to a terminally ill patient.</p>
<p>In short, Americans are beginning to view basic health care as a "right" and not as a "good" to be rationed by the free market.  Eventually, politics will catch up with public attitudes.  Regulating "private" insurance company behavior is the first step in that process.</p>

<p>I love statements like that. "It's time for corporations to pay," usually followed by "their fair share." Except corporations are legal entities to whom fairness doesn't apply. Corporations essentially belong to their shareholders, who, as far as I know, are people, too. Sometimes this happens through mutual funds and pension funds, but ultimately, these are all people. Corporate taxes are just passed down to customers, who are also people. Taxing them also reduces their ability to hire people. If we want to tax the rich, let's tax the rich. But let's not cloak it by saying we're taxing "corporations." They don't care. People will always end up paying. </p>

<p>Haris. perhaps a bit of clarification is indicated"</p>
<p>"I end up with corporations pitching in an amount similar to their current participation and filling the gap with taxes."</p>
<p>........ In our current patchwork of health care mess, many of our oldest and most established corporations ARE saddled with the cost of their employee's health care.  Though! as you point out in your "protect them from taxation" line........ likewise the employee is, in essence, paying for his own health care via it being a cost of employment.</p>
<p>...... You likely know that the weird anomaly of health care being a part of SOME folk's employment package came from getting around a WWII wage/price freeze and that no rational policy wonk would have  ever considered putting it in the hands of the corporations.  As you also know? the "system" is broken and not only costs US twice what the civilized nations pay, but is taking down a number of our corporations with it.  (The former "Big Three" come quickly to mind.)</p>
<p>So......... to get the funding out of the corporate employer model and TO a more individual basis, how would you go about funding a more rational system for an age when A. people do not stick with a single corp for life and B. the corps can not be trusted with such a responsibility?</p>
<p>Here's what I would propose (and I think the current health care bagholders would be happy as clams on a sunny beach about)  Say those who DO pay healthcare ARE pitching in some number like $250 billion or so.  Let us fairly spread, roughly that amount in taxes over ALL employers such that for the most part Ford is no longer paying the health care costs of family members who work for Taco Bell or a small company that "can not afford" to provide health care.  </p>
<p>The revenue from this source would not pay for the whole program just as it does not today.  So? how to fill the rest of the void?  Sadly, because the wage pyramid is SO utterly out of whack, low income earners have zipnada to pitch in, thus there is no rational alternative but to have the rest come from individual taxes.  </p>
<p>Now before rejecting the raising of healthcare funding by these means, keep in mind that the goal is that of paying a LOWER percentage of our GDP for healthcare. (You'll note we spend 16% or more while most other nations spend less than 10% of a smaller GDP for BETTER results.)</p>
<p>So far...... I've put forth the means of raising the funds, now let's move on to using "the market" effectively to give us the best value for our buck of expenditure.  </p>
<p>BTW........ do YOU find any value added aspects of  our "insurance" industry worthy of even a small fraction of what that monstrous parasite costs?  </p>

<p>David? Do you disagree with "basic health care being a right?"  in this richest of countries?</p>
<p>Given that ALL government workers and teachers are  "covered" along with all active and retired military, those working at all levels for our major corporations, along with Medicare, Medicaid and welfare recipients, is there a reason you'd favor NOT providing "basic health care" to, primarily those working very hard every day for small businesses that "can not afford" healthcare? </p>
<p>Would you just let them pile up outside the ER? Other? Perhaps list who you'd deny?   And if the number is near zero, why we spend a major fraction of our health care dollar sorting out "coverage" et al?   </p>

<p>I'll spare you the gruesome health insurance details of the self employed. Needless too say, most of the private health insurance coverage out there is abysmal at best and the industry is dominated by shysters. </p>
<p>If the private entrepenuer is the salvation of the National Economy, why can't they afford even basic health coverage for themselves. I and others I know are actually thinking of emigrating to either Canada or Australia and taking our skills, knowledge and entrepenural spirit with us. One question, how does that help the National Economy? Just a little something too think about.</p>

<p>The statement about economic illiteracy is insulting, offensive, and, may I say, idiotic. </p>
<p>Why assume that people are unaware of the consequences of certain policies? Isn't it just possible that the public is willing to pay higher insurance costs, or higher taxes, to see to it that those with genetic health problems do not face ruinous costs?</p>
<p>Further, where does Posner come off accusing others of "economic illiteracy?" His own understanding seems to me to be limited, and highly biased by his libertarian ideology. Look to the beam in your own eye, Judge Posner. </p>

<p>"Isn't it just possible that the public is willing to pay higher insurance costs, or higher taxes, to see to it that those with genetic health problems do not face ruinous costs?"</p>
<p>That isn't really a response to the statement. Of course it's possible that Americans want what you said. That doesn't mean they're economically illiterate. But if they think that insurers shouldn't be permitted to raise premiums or deny coverage in this situation, that's a pretty clear indication that they are. The economic reality is that genetic defects pose greater risks and thus merit higher premiums [under the current system]. If anything, the poll shows that Americans are willing to make someone else pay [as opposed to themselves, the taxpayers]. Since doing this will merely push the costs on them in some other way, it really does show that there is less than necessary consideration of economic realities in America.</p>

I understand what you're getting at, but my point is that a tax on corporations or as you say "employers" is merely a tax on individuals that is more politically popular. Taxing an employer raises that employer's cost of business. That means that the prices of its product are higher and either wages are lower or fewer people are hired. In either case, individuals bear the cost, and often these individuals are poor or middle class. If we really want to have a progressive tax code, corporate taxes should be zero and taxes on individuals should reflect whatever we consider "fair." Taxing corporations is simply hiding who is actually paying the tax.</p>

<p>Haris........ I surely understand the concept, having had it drilled into my ears every time I get near a right wing corporate loyalist!  But! truth is corporate taxes are at their lowest rates in the post war era and STILL many of them resort to "abusive transfer" tax avoidance and related games under the Carribean sun.  </p>
<p>Naturally what you say about the corporate tax bite "trickling down" to its consumers is true, but, the same must be said for ALL tax bites. I'm probably outnumbered by "libertarians" here in strongly favoring progressivity in taxation, and especially so as the wage/wealth gap grows to democracy killing levels.  I favor a similar tax schedule for corporations as some industries have a very hard time making any profit, while others such as our price fixing oil companies, oligopolists such as MSFT and ethanol scammer ADM, along with "cost plus" war profiteers, can and should do their part.  </p>
<p>BTW........ I really don't buy the "passed on" theory whole cloth as I still believe that at least SOME corporations ARE engaged in competition and that Walmart? might rather take the tax bite out of their enormous levels of retained earnings (or? see it they COULD chisel a bit more from their already underpaid employees) than lose their  competitive edge.  You'll recall the very high rates during WWII that served both to help pay the enormous costs of that war as well as to curb the incentive to engage in war profiteering, and today, I'd be happy to see Haliburton end up with it's normal corporate profit, but not to benefit as greatly as they have from multi-billion buck, sole source, cost plus, "old boy" contracts.  Instead in exchange for such a portion of the gleanings they should have been treated as something of a regulated utility.  After all, US taxpayers are NOT getting rich from this little adventure and have been pretty good sports (so far) on being ripped off and further inD E B T E D.</p>

<p>Posner's article is interesting. I must quibble with one tiny part of it, however.</p>
<blockquote>
Eighty percent of Americans tell pollsters that they do not think that health insurers should be allowed to deny coverage or charge higher premiums to people with genetic defects. This is an example of Americans' economic illiteracy.
</blockquote>
<p>This is not necessarily an example of economic illiteracy. I am economically illiterate, but I agree that genetic defects should not be revealed to employers or health insurance companies. There are Ph.D. economists who think likewise. Clearly, such economists are not economically illiterate.</p>
<p>There is a reason for not allowing employers and insurers to consider this information. Because one values social insurance and realizes that this a politically feasible way of obtaining that goal. Clearly, there will always be some level of tradeoff between providing social insurance on one hand and maximizing economic wealth on the other. So, an economically literate person who values social insurance more than Posner could rationally come to the opposite conlcusion.</p>
<p>Of course, some economists might argue that all wealth transfers should occur through the tax system. But, that fails to take into account political feasibility on one hand and it is not really an argument that the disincentives of higher income taxes are in fact less severe than other sorts of disincentives on the other.</p>

<p>In the public health area people are often asked to pay higher prices to obtain<br/>
a greater good for society as a whole.  House builders in the US are required<br/>
to provide indoor plumbing and an electric system that is up to code.  It is not<br/>
considered a problem that poor people thereby cannot afford a new house.  They<br/>
are also priced out of the car market by government requirements for safety.<br/>
In these areas there is a trickle down effect where the "health" systems get<br/>
passed along when the items are sold used.  As we move into a service economy<br/>
we are pulling out these existing mechanisms for ensuring universal health and<br/>
safety and applying them to services for which there is no secondary market.<br/>
It would be nice if I could obtain health insurance from one company, strip or<br/>
add benefits, and resell it to someone else but that is not permitted. <br/>
&lt;p/&gt;<br/>
The only way the public has to negotiate with the corporation on an even basis<br/>
is through the legislative process.  I have no chance to get a clause in my<br/>
company's health insurance policy protecting me from price rises due to the<br/>
results of a genetic test.  I can only turn to the government if that is what I<br/>

<p>That does not mean they object to premiums being higher overall, in order to cover these individuals, just that they think the added cost should not be borne solely by those who have the genetic problems. </p>

<p>"Lastly? if after the above you STILL want to let the corps dump their health care programs on us; are you willing to shoulder your share of the extra burden? Jack"</p>
<p>I won't even ask how corporations, lifeless entities who don't get sick, have health care burdens, other than whatever we choose to give them.  Anyway, I am already shouldering whatever share of the burden is mine. It's just not on my tax bill. Instead, it's in form of higher prices &amp; lower wages, and lower investment returns. The average worker's pension fund that invests in corporate stocks suffers when corporate profits are lowered due to taxes - the worker, ultimately, bears the cost of the corporate tax. <br/>
You may not believe in the passing on of prices, but you can't deny that if the price of something rises, you buy less of it. Making labor more expensive through corporate taxes or mandatory employer-provided health care will unquestionably result in fewer people being hired, or at lower wages. The inability to get jobs that would otherwise exist, or the lower wages resulting from such taxes, are ultimately where the corporate taxes manifest themselves.

<p>Jack:</p>
<p>Perhaps the tone of my comment was not sufficiently clear.  I support universal health insurance (though I am as yet undecided on the method through which it should be achieved).  In fact, I believe that universal coverage is not only "just" and "good," but that it will make Americans healthier as a whole and thus lower health care costs overall.  In particular, it will lower the costs associated with treating the large number of chronically unhealthy Americans (note the current epidemic of type II diabetes), by keeping them healthier in the first instance.  It will also save greatly on administrative costs.</p>
<p>I meant it as a good thing that Americans are beginning to view basic health care as a "right."  Posner's analysis is flawed, because he insists on treating health care the same as any luxury good.  Almost every other industrialized country has universal health care.  I merely noted that our politicians are behind the public on this issue (still indebted to the status quo), but they are beginning to catch up.<br/>

<p>Well, we're in about the same space and so far I'm sure of only the fund raising side; all have to be in the pool.  Then, were our incomes not SO screwed up, all should chip in to pay for it.  But! wealth and high wages are being decoupled from "going to work and following the rules" and zipnada is "trickling down" from overall increases in productivity, so we're again stuck with tax those with the gilt to pay for the care and maintenance of the slaves and serfs.</p>
<p>The delivery and cost controlling side is the toughie, so instead of the rationing by waiting in line of some universal systems, I guess I'd hope to harness some market based efficiencies by allowing the consumer to enter system via a coupon he can use at competing providers.  </p>
<p>Perhaps along the lines of the provider getting a certain amount for each young person they enroll and more for older patients.  I'd the provider would be squeezed to hold down costs and to attract his customers by offering good service or amenities beyond that of some basic contract. </p>

<p>As someone who spent quite a few years without health insurance, I can say with conviction that lack of health insurance does not doom one to poor health, or even poorly administered health care.  It just means that at the end of the day, you are stuck with the bill. Certainly it means that you are less likely to use the doctor for minor issues, but it does not prohibit you from doing so.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
But to revisit Posner's closing line, charging 80% of Americans with economic illiteracy, he is of course referring to the most basic and most common flaw in typical non-economic thinking: the belief in a free lunch.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
Laws cannot change underlying reality, despite earnest hopes and good intentions.  Scarcity exists, so we either ration by price or by other means.  Insurance companies may be amoral, but they aren't stupid.  They will get their money, and those of us stuck paying artificially high premiums thanks to government-imposed mandates will be screwed big-time.  Thanks Democrats!</p>

<p>Christina, There's a flaw in your rational in blaming the Democrats. :) They've been out of power in the Congress for the last twelve years, over which the health care and insurance issues developed and came to the forefront. Talk about the "kettle" calling the "pot" black. The reason we have this and many other problems confronting the Nation, is that the Republicans, instead of dealing with and solving them as they have come up, they have resorted to name calling and blaming someone else in order to maintain their tenous hold on power and obscrue the real issues. Especially, when their "free market" model and paradigm fails in the real world. </p>

<p>Posner: In the limit, if everyone's health prospects were known with certainty, there would be no market for health insurance at all.</p>
<p>This is not true.   The plausible limit case is one in which science will know very well an individual's probability of getting sick in the future.  There will still be uncertainty about whether and when the individual gets sick.   As long as there is individual uncertainty that is greater than the aggreagte uncertainty, there is room for insurance.   In fact, better knowledge about probabilities will make the insurance market   more efficient (as Posner also points out).  </p>

<p>I'm a little suprised that (unless my reading has been careless) nobody has mentioned the problem of overinsurance here.</p>
<p>Current problems with the healthcare system result in significant part to the excess incentive provided on the insuring of individuals through their employers.  The ban on the use of genetic information by health insurers provides a subsidy to people with genetic predispositions to bad, expensive diseases -- but *only* if they buy health insurance.  These are the people for whom moral hazard is likely to be worst; allowing costs to appropriately encourage them to adapt to the fact that they have such a predisposition or choose a cheaper but less complete treatment if the value to them of the more expensive treatment is not worth its added expense is in fact at its most valuable for exactly these high-expense individuals.</p>
<p>In fact, the classic classical-economist improvement on the proposal is "give each person with a genetic defect a lump-sum that would exactly compensate them for the added cost of insuring themselves, and keep their marginal prices the same".  There are, no doubt, problems with this -- wealth effects come to mind first -- but they aren't, in fact, as bad as what this law would do.  Ideally, you want carriers of genetic flaws to face an incentive to procreate that differs from that faced by noncarriers by the cost that is being externalized here, but that starts to make things ever more complicated, so I'll drop that here.</p>
<p>A couple other points, though, that I'll make with reference to some of the comments: 1) While current problems result in significant part from over-insurance, there may be even more contribution from this "healthcare is a right" -- or, more to the point, "healthcare is not an economic good, but is immune to things like differing consumer preferences (both within this catch-all "healthcare" and between it and everything else) and real trade-offs involved".  If more people were more sober about buying healthcare the way they buy shaving cream a lot of problems would be quite reduced.  2) The comment about "if healthcare prospects were known with certainty" is, in fact, a useful pedagogical tool; it helps distinguish between what part of the discussion is actually "healthcare" and what part is "insurance".  Disentangling these issues at first is clarifying, so you can see how they interact.  He's not suggesting it's realistic; it is, however, a useful analytical device.  80% of Americans, though, are too thick to handle abstraction.  It's a scientific fact.</p>

<p>"discussion is actually "healthcare" and what part is "insurance". Disentangling these issues at first is clarifying, so you can see how they interact."</p>
<p>....... hmmm, perhaps you're the guy to help me disentangle the two?  Now I DO have the abstract reasoning powers to understand the claimed "overuse" by those going to a doc for every little cold.  But having noted how much expense is due to the poor and mostly under-insured not getting pre-natal care, proper diabetic care, missing cancer diagnosis until it's "too late" and other preventative care that adds considerably to major medical costs that would be insured.</p>
<p>....... BTW for the "overuse" part WERE we able to crack into the AMA Union a bit, I'd propose more use of para-medics as seems to work quite well for our military and the VA. It doesn't need to be a budget busting event to take a sick kid to see someone and perhaps ease his symptoms, screen for more serious issues, as well as console a young mom who's been up all nite, is unsure, and very likely  having to leave for her day job. </p>

<p>Posner writes,</p>
<p><i>So even if the new law led to more genetic testing--which probably it would not do, for the reasons stated at the outset--its social costs, from the standpoint of economic efficiency, would probably be negative.</i></p>
<p>Aside from my other objections to Posner's post, I would call attention to his two uses of the word "probably" in this sentence. I see nothing in his arguments that justifies the use of that word.</p>
<p>In the first case he identifies factors that suggest there would be lots of genetic testing without the proposed law. But where is the support - logical or empirical - for the proposition that these factors are likely to lead to more testing than the proposal would?</p>
<p>In the second he mentions a possible problem created by the new law. Insurance rates will be higher, hence some individuals will not buy insurance, hence some individuals, who would be tested if insured, would not be tested under the new law. Now this is pretty tenuous, but even granting that some individuals will be affected this way, there is nothing in the argument to show that this effect outweighs the social benefits of increased testing induced by the law. </p>
<p>In short, I think Posner's objections, to the degree they are based on his assessment of the relative probabilities he mentions, are unsupported by his arguments.</p>

<p>Aye, another all too common misconception. A political decision that results in such a law would result in higher premiums for all of us. What if paying those extra premiums means that people who would have otherwise been able to take better care of their children can no longer do so? What if for every life saved, many more are lost because we choose to redistribute the health care burden? How is that "wise and just"? How is it fair that children whose parents, forced to pay higher premiums, can no longer afford to pay for the health and safety they wish to, and as a result these innocent children die? Think about this when you say that the proposed law is wise and just. Simply passing the law doesn't change the underlying realities. The law would simply pass the costs to someone else. Think about if it is wise and just to pass these costs to someone who did nothing to warrant bearing these costs.</p>

<p>I agree, it'd be pretty hard to blame a genetic defect on "personal responsibility." But the larger point, which you correctly noted, is that someone who did nothing to warrant bearing certain costs will end up bearing them. My instinct is to do less rather than more, especially when it comes to genetic endowment: we all have to deal with our height, skin color, hair color, and other genetic predispositions, so the 'natural' position is to not interfere.<br/>
That said, I certainly don't think people with genetic defects or certain predisposition should be left to their own devices because their condition is "not our fault." But to be truly fair, we have to remember the impact our help to one group is having on another.</p>
<p>NE: I'm getting more confused. Omission doesn't happen without a duty to act. So, for a sin of omission, someone must assume [or, more often, be assigned] a duty to act. Are you justifying hurting the few for the benefit of the many?</p>

<p>Now you say that those with such defects should not be left to their own devices. Good. But that doesn't seem to square with your previous position. As for the "natural" predisposition not to interfere with say, hair color, that hardly seems to apply to matters of physical wellbeing. </p>

<p>Not leaving people to their own devices is perfectly compatible with being aware that costs are born by people who bear no responsibility. I'm siding with those who favor some sort of social insurance. I'm just saying that the costs of social insurance must be balanced against the benefits. The particular law that is under consideration, which would prohibit a sort of genetic discrimination by private insurers, seems to be quite possibly the worst way address the situation.</p>

<p>I think one of the best aids to considering any public policy is to consider the proposal as if you did not know your own position in that society might be. Often that's the case anyway as those who might have favored legislation favorable to the well-off may lose that status.</p>
<p>Perhaps this perspective is useful in the area of genetic testing (which is largely positive) and allowing "insurance" companies to use the data to cherry pick the members of their "risk" pool. The exercise is simple. Before you have yourself or other family members tested THAT is the time to decide whether there are any societal benefits to casting those who "fail" out of the pool. </p>
<p>From there we might move on to consider the utility of insurance companies or other forms of risk pooling who are using the testing data to go through the deck looking for the cards that will make up their most profitable hand. </p>
<p>Then, since "insurance" companies have costly overhead and profit margins why would those who are healthy, have been tested and have a brighter than average outlook, bother to pay them?  Next? of course some of them will be wrong and have costly medical emergency and have little choice but to file bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, down the street those who've been excluded from the pool are also having  their, predictable, expensive emergency.  All but a few of them soon join the healthy set in bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>Perhaps those who voiced an opinion not "doing something nice" for the sick or lame will finish there thought and tell us what they would do with them?     </p>

<p>I see. You endorse the objective, but think this specific mechanism is undesirable. Sorry. I misunderstood your position.</p>
<p>Still, as you point out, there will be costs and someone will have to pay them. That will mean either higher taxes or higher insurance premiums, either of which may have the consequences you describe. </p>

I'm afraid I can't answer your question intelligently at this point. The theory depends on costs and benefits, and I don't even have a ballpark idea of costs and benefits of any program. How many people have genetic defects, how many of them will get sick, what percentage of the population do they constitute, what is the average cost of early treatment vs. late treatment, what is the alternate use of the social insurance funds, what are the distortionary effects on cost of a third-party payer? I'm sure we can get at least some rough numbers on this before we have to make a decision. If pressed, I'd favor a social insurance paid for by a very broad tax, like the income tax; it'd be something akin to extending Medicare to everyone. The reason I favor that is that it places an explicit figure into the federal budget that lets everyone know who's paying for this insurance and how much, rather than hiding it  by passing it to private insurers and insurance buyers. Since I don't know the details of the genetic tests or the associated diseases, I'd be hard-pressed to define what the social insurance would cover and how to contain costs. It's obviously not an easy problem, else someone on this blog would have solved it by now. What bothers me is that I don't see a sustainable middle ground between universal insurance [with all its inefficiencies] and pure private markets [efficient, but 'unfair' in a very specific sense]. <br/>
I apologize for the long and probably incoherent post. The overarching point is that without some numbers, I can't really make an intelligent policy decision. But the framework for the analysis is in place.</p>

<p>Haris... Well, I think you tacked your way to a viable conclusion. Perhaps get rid of your concern as to the cost of caring for those with "genetic defects".  (I like to put that term in quotes, you know, so as to hint that most of us share some of those, be it a predilection for early heart trouble, sickle cell, diabetes, serious allergies and the rest of a very long list.)  Or, if you think policy should pivot on "cost" please indicate how the very costly individual cases SHOULD be handled?  </p>
<p>BTW I find it interesting that Posner "the Libertarian" ends up favoring taxation as the  means of burden sharing.  I join with him, but while he hangs his hat on the marginal case of higher health care premiums adding yet a few more to the 45 million who can not, or will not pay for health insurance; I hang mine on the fact that low income groups can NOT afford medical insurance and that spreading the risk via taxation  is the only viable means of paying the costs.  </p>
<p>Thirty other countries have adopted some version of "all IN the risk pool", how long are we to pretend what we have offers any "market based" advantages, and waste our resources fiddling with "covered" "pre-existing" and increasingly playing more cat and mouse with the results of genetic testing?  </p>
<p>BTW....... how many "libertarians" here note and oppose the clearly market distortive effects of health care benefits operating as leverage to enslave those who might otherwise benefit themselves and our society by applying their talents elsewhere?  </p>

Catastrophic health care claims belong in the biggest pool available, something similar to what Kerry proposed during one of the most mis-managed campaigns ever. But The problem is how to define "very costly." To use Kerry's example, let's say claims of over $50,000 shift to the government. That creates great incentives for every incident costing upwards of $30,000 to be made more expensive so that the government, rather than individuals or private insurers pay. [I won't even try to define "incident."] That's what drives me even more towards universal coverage. But I keep bringing up that single payer systems have many pitfalls [what's the average wait for an MRI in Canada?] and someone smarter than I should figure out how to avoid them.<br/>
Also, I do favor a cost v. benefit analysis. Remember that every resource spent on someone's health could be used for someone else's health. If we want to extend and improve lives, shouldn't we improve as many as we can for the same price?</p>
<p>Also, the tying of employment to insurance and the problems with that have been amply documented. I'm with you there, especially on the mobility effects.<br/>

[I won't even try to define "incident."] That's what drives me even more towards universal coverage.</p>
<p>....... Right On!!  Finance writer Andrew Tobias wrote and lobbied for a "pay at the pump" means of paying for auto insurance. The plan has a host of advantages, including NO uninsured motorists, that you'd have a choice of having any number of vehicles and pay insurance only when you gas up and hit the road. You can see advantages that because the variable cost of driving would rise while the fixed cost would drop of driving the most efficient car of your fleet, and extra incentives to leave it home.  Naturally this would  require a "no-fault" approach which in itself saves money.  But, as you mention, so far no state has a true no-fault with MI having the closest, but it's no-fault up to $4,000 or so which gives exactly the incentive you mention to push up the amount of the claim.  (It takes a small book to consider the whole scheme but it would be VERY beneficial to nearly all Americans other than those selling insurance on commission and the Bar Assn.)</p>
<p>Because there seems no way around the adverse selection problem I conclude the pool must be universal.  Once that bridge has been crossed, the next may be that of the contractual agreement and there's bound to be a tug of war of some sort.  </p>
<p> But I keep bringing up that single payer systems have many pitfalls [what's the average wait for an MRI in Canada?] and someone smarter than I should figure out how to avoid them.</p>
<p>......... There I think we can learn from them and do something uniquely American.  What occurs to me is "single payer --- multi-supplier"....... with a number of HMO's PPO's or other groups vying for customers by competing on service and providing more than what might be specified in a basic coverage contract.  (There's a flaw in my approach as there will be in any approach, in that the amount the single payer voucher would have to be set by a political process...... but I think the savings of NOT paying insurance cos, lawyers and all the related drags on our existing mess would mean we could cover all of our people for less than the current 16-18% of GDP (plus court costs??) and approach the 8-10% of GDP spent by nations with universal care.... in short there's plenty of money to fix people up bet we're wasting 50% arguing about who pays.</p>
<p><br/>
Also, I do favor a cost v. benefit analysis. Remember that every resource spent on someone's health could be used for someone else's health.</p>
<p>......... yes... and a sticky problem it is too.  We know that in some venues they do a LOT of invasive and very costly heart surgeries while others do many less and appear to have similar outcomes.  (Tough to measure though, eh? as one might live as long without open heart surgery, but have to live with angina? and fear to go five miles from the hospital?)</p>
<p> If we want to extend and improve lives, shouldn't we improve as many as we can for the same price?</p>
<p>......... Yup! And I think the VA may save money on caring for their patients by insisting on regular check-ups and freely encouraging those "at risk" to take flu shots etc.  With computers I think we could find out even more than we do, for example a mammogram might have no copay at all or even, if one woman will coax her friend to go too perhaps they'd both get a coupon for lunch or some such small incentive. </p>
<p>Also, the tying of employment to insurance and the problems with that have been amply documented. I'm with you there, especially on the mobility effects.</p>
<p>......... Yes! and all the "futurists" predict a speeding up of job changes during one's career.  It just ain't WWII anymore!  </p>
<p>........ as I consider a voucher system, in essence creating something of a fixed price competition by the various providers (though in a more detailed look, the voucher for a 25 year old would be less than that of a 50 year old) I'm reminded of the pre-dereg competition among airlines.  While it (apparently) didn't do all that well at driving down costs they did compete on service.  In fact, I guess there are other similarities, as even in today's cut throat airline competition they aren't allowed to "compete" down to the point of not maintaining safety standards (I hope!) and still make quite an attempt to maintain their on-time record. Then while its most profitable for them to fly full, they have to weigh giving up market share by being  too booked up. </p>
<p>Anyway, from what we agree upon, if we COULD tie our insurance hors to the mast and apply several layers of duct tape to mouths of our barristers I think we could design a system FAR better than the mess we've inherited and most likely better than that of the 30 other countries offering universal health care and where "medical bankruptcy" is not often heard. </p>

You'll notice you listed industries that are characterized by extensive government intervention. Licensing requirements, patents, and the nature of resource exploitation etc all open up opportunities for cartels, which lead to the ills of monopoly/oligopoly. I'm still not sure why people are allowed to trade price for quality in everything, except god forbid they chose to go to a nurse rather than a full-fledge doctor, or a paralegal rather than a member of the bar. Loosening the barriers to entry would probably go a long way to breaking up the government-enabled cartels.</p>
