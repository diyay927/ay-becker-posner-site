<p><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">I agree with Becker; no matter how badly the Fed performed in the run-up to the financial collapse of September 2008, stripping it of its political independence could only make things worse.</span></p>
<p><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook"></span><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">The Fed indeed performed badly, and Bernanke himself—not just Greenspan—must (though he’s refusing to) shoulder a significant share of the blame. Bernanke approved of, and may even have played the key role in advocating, Greenspan’s policy of pushing interest rates way down beginning late in 2001, keeping them there, and promising that when the Fed started raising rates it would do so gradually and would use monetary policy to prevent asset prices from diving in consequence of higher rates (that is, it would push down interest rates, which would firm up housing prices because houses are a product bought mainly with credit). These actions by the Fed nourished the housing bubble.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">The Fed not only mismanaged monetary policy, but was notably lax in regulating the commercial banks and bank holding companies, ignored warning signs of a coming financial collapse, and prepared no contingency plans to deal with such a crisis even after Bear Stearns’ collapse signaled the existence of potential solvency problems in a wide range of banks and “shadow banks” (such as Bear Stearns, a broker-dealer rather than a commercial bank). The Fed was blindsided by the collapse of the other dominoes in September 2008 and blundered gravely in failing to bail out Lehman Brothers, a failure that precipitated a run on the other shadow banks.</span></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">   </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook"></span><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">These failures have shaken confidence in the Fed, and provide I think a strong argument against giving the Fed additional powers. But the failures do not provide an argument for reducing the Fed’s political independence. The critical reason is Becker’s: looking back at the behavior of Congress in the years and months (and weeks and days) preceding the financial collapse of September 2008, there is absolutely no reason to think that, had Congress exercised more control over the Fed, the financial collapse would have been averted or its gravity diminished.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><o:p><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook"></span></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">The reason is related to the principal argument for the independence of a nation’s central bank: that without it there would be much more inflation. Politicians want low interest rates because they stimulate economic activity and thus create at least the illusion of prosperity, for which politicians want to take credit. But if inflation is already high or expected to be high, low interest rates create a serious risk of more inflation. The reason is that the way a central bank reduces interest rates (to simplify) is by buying Treasury securities; the cash it pays for them increases bank balances and therefore reduces interest rates and stimulates lending. The more lending, the more spending, and the more spending the more money there is in circulation relative to output and therefore the more inflation there is, since inflation is determined by the ratio between the amount of money in circulation and the amount of goods and services available for purchase.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook"></span> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">Congress would undoubtedly have wanted interest rates to stay low throughout the past decade and thus would have fought the Fed had the latter heeded warnings of a housing bubble and raised interest rates. In fact there <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">was</em> inflation—asset-price inflation, the assets being houses and common stock, and at times oil and other commodities. The Fed should have raised interest rates higher and earlier, and probably would have done so if it had realized that there was asset-price inflation. But had it done so, it would have caused a slowdown in economic activity, and Congress would have intervened had it not been for the Fed’s independence. Elected officials have short time horizons.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">The Fed isn’t really <em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">that</em> independent because, unlike the independence of the Supreme Court from the other branches of government, the Fed’s independence is not based on the Constitution but merely on statute, and Congress can change a federal statute at any time. Because of this the Fed cannot ignore political pressures entirely. But if the “reformers” get their way, the political pressures will operate directly, and inflation will be an even more serious problem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">The hostility to Fed is in part a hostility to “Wall Street,” especially to firms like Goldman Sachs which have made enormous profits this year while most of the country was suffering from the economic downturn. The combination of the government’s having bailed out Goldman and the other big banks, thereby signaling that it will not allow such firms to fail, and the Fed’s current interest-rate policy, which has pushed short-term interest rates down almost to zero, has enabled Goldman to borrow capital at very low rates and lend or otherwise invest it very profitably because the distress of other banks has reduced aggregate private lending and investing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span size="3" style="FONT-FAMILY: Century Schoolbook">Because private banks elect two-thirds of the members of the board of directors of each of the 12 regional federal reserve banks, and five of the presidents of those banks serve on a rotating basis on the Federal Open Market Committee—the body within the Fed that sets monetary policy and thus interest rates—there is suspicion that the Fed is a tool of Wall Street. That impression would be dissipated, to a degree anyway, by cutting the private banks out of any role in determining the governance of the federal reserve banks. Such a change might reduce the political pressure to reduce the Fed’s independence.</span></p>
